I think this makes it easier to control the style without making the code too noisy. Just a simple guard check at the top of the relevant function before early exiting. I got it to the same state as master now, but the new proposed style features in #74 would be easier to understand. One caveat of this style is more allocations. Sorry about the huge code dump. Since we didn't discuss this beforehand, it's fine to close if you want to follow a different path.

If available, bat picks the first predefined style in the user-supplied style-list and ignores everything else. If no predefined style was requested, the other parameters that are simple output components will be used.

Examples:

1. `--style changes,full,numbers`
    Will be reduced to only the predefined style `full`.

2. `--style plain,full`
    Will be reduced to only the predefined style `plain`.

3. `--style changes,numbers`
    Will not be reduced, because the list does not contain any predefined styles.

(Note: if `grid` is requested but no other parameters, bat still creates the left-most column with a width of `PANEL_WIDTH`. I didn't want to introduce further logic in this PR that drops or adapts the width of the left column.)

102,Added text wrapping. (Fixes #54),"I use bat pretty frequently, so I wanted to give back and make it even better by adding text wrapping (issue #54).

I've never touched Rust before this, and I apologize if the code style is weird or if any of my changes have less-than-ideal performance.

## Changes:
- **Text wrapping.**
   Lines will now automatically wrap at a character boundary.
   Syntax coloring will also wrap.

- **Resizing gutter (panel).**
   The gutter (area that shows line numbers and changes) will now automatically resize.
   This cuts back on the amount of wasted space when not showing everything.

   It will also disappear if not needed.

# Caveats
Due to the way that all the input is formatted with the default styling before being printed, I had to use the ANSI escape sequences as prefixes to the input text. Not doing so would result in the ANSI styles being overridden like so: `\x1B[32m\x1B[0m`.

290,Handle `less` in a portable way,"The current logic for special-casing `less` relies on the pager being specified as the literal string or using Unix-style paths. It also ignores the actual pager specified when calling it, so even if you set `PAGER`/`BAT_PAGER` to `/my/path/to/less`, `bat` will simply call `less`.

This PR treats any specified pager as a path and checks only the file stem so that `C:\foo\bar\less.exe`, `/foo/bar/less`, and `less` are all recognized.  It also uses the specified `less`.

I managed to write a test for this by creating a stub `bin/less.rs` that verifies its arguments and the environment. However, this binary was installed along with `bat` when running `cargo install`. [I haven’t yet found a way to test the behaviour without this issue](https://stackoverflow.com/q/52205295/8492116), so for the moment I can only offer the fix without the test (but with the assurance that I’ve tested its behaviour both manually and automatically).",31,941,2018-09-07 12:34:12+00:00,2018-09-07 19:47:33+00:00,2018-09-12 20:42:42+00:00,2018-09-07 19:47:33+00:00,closed,True,3,1,7,2,1,7,2,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,sharkdp/bat

302,Tab expansion support.,"This pull request adds support for expanding tabs into column-aligned spaces (similar to `expand(1)`). Issues #166 and #184 are fixed when using this feature.

By default, tab width is set to 8 characters. This can be overridden with `--tabs=[n]` or `export BAT_TABS=[n]`. It can also be turned off entirely by setting the value to `0`.

To allow for lossless copy-pasting, when neither the pager nor the decorations are being used, the default tab width will be set to `0` (passthrough).

## Implementation

The function `expand` (`src/preprocessor.rs`) is run for every line inside `InteractivePrinter.print_line`, after the syntax highlighting is processed. ANSI characters are directly passed through while tabs are interpreted and replaced with spaces. The number of spaces depends on the calculated cursor position, and will always try to align the columns.

## Additional Information

Three new tests have been created for this feature:

* tabs_4
* tabs_8
* tabs_passthrough

A couple of small changes were made to the tester scripts and `generate_snapshots.py` was fixed to use the interactive printer for generating snapshots.

## Example

Before:

```

```

The option can be use multiple times. Note that you can easily make
these mappings permanent by using `bat`s new configuration file.

395,Feature: Highlight non-printable characters,"Adds a new `-A`/`--show-all` option (in analogy to GNU Linux `cat`s option) that
highlights non-printable characters like space, tab or newline.

This works in two steps:
- **Preprocessing**: replace space by `•`, replace tab by `├──┤`, replace
newline by `␤`, etc.
- **Highlighting**: Use a newly written Sublime syntax to highlight
these special symbols.

#### without `--show-all`

#### with `--show-all`
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4209276/47851032-ad4cd180-ddd7-11e8-9bee-d4eab8e95a8a.png)


Remarks:
- This feature is not technically a drop-in replacement for GNU `cat`s `--show-all` but it has the same purpose.
- This replaces normal syntax highlighting. You can not use syntax highlighting with `--show-all`.
- Tab-width can be controlled via `--tabs N`
- This closes #381 (see also: #228)",43,951,2018-11-01 12:11:51+00:00,2018-11-01 21:00:49+00:00,2018-11-01 21:00:52+00:00,2018-11-01 21:00:49+00:00,closed,True,4,4,98,6,6,98,6,1,0,5,5,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,sharkdp/bat

543,"Add 3 new themes: ansi-light, ansi-dark, base16","Fixes #490

To summarize that issue: some people change their color theme often, perhaps switching between a light theme and dark theme. In these cases, no single bat theme works well. In addition, some people really want colored output to be congruous with the rest of their terminal programs, and don't care so much about it using a wide range of colors. In both cases, a solution is to use the 8- or 16-ANSI color palette the user has already configured for their terminal. The key difference is the added level of indirection: instead of choosing colors, we choose palette numbers and the user chooses colors.

This PR adds three new themes. They are based on the [base16 textmate theme][1], but modified to encode the 16 palette numbers as RGB colours ""#000000"" through ""#0f0000"". This is necessary because tmTheme/[Syntect][2] require concrete RGB colors. It's might seem slightly hacky, but I don't think it's worth generalizing Syntect to other notions of color just so we can pass it the number 10 instead of the string ""#0a0000"".

Here's how the themes should be used:

- **ansi-light**: This should look decent in any terminal with a light background. It uses only the first 8 colors from the ANSI palette.
- **ansi-dark**: Like ansi-light, but for dark backgrounds. These two themes need to be separate so that we use the right foreground color for ordinary text.
- **base16**: This will look perfect for anyone using a theme designed around the [base16][3] palette. We don't need a light and dark version because base16 themes always have background/foreground in fixed slots.

Note, I just put the new theme files in `assets/themes` for now. It works if I build the cache from that directory. The README seems to say I'm not supposed to check in the new binary files with my PR, however.

### Screenshots

I ran `bat --list-themes` on three color themes for macOS Terminal.app.

Default light profile:

<img width=""618"" alt=""ansi-light"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/316673/56084136-bb7a3180-5dfc-11e9-979a-55739c2fa9dd.png"">

Dark profile:

<img width=""618"" alt=""ansi-dark"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/316673/56084144-d8166980-5dfc-11e9-94d5-5deef619e8cd.png"">

Base16 Ocean profile:

In general, the base16 ones might look ok for non-base16 profiles, or it might look terrible. It depends on how the upper 8 of the 16 colors are configured. The ansi themes work on anything, but for base16 profiles the base16 theme will look better (thought it might be hard to tell in the above screenshot).

The basic principle of the solution is the same as what I described in #553, and it has the same caveats, but this is a better implementation that only uses `awk`.

## Features:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32112321/57062440-f68db900-6c74-11e9-9b1c-386c40224fb2.png)

- Lists all languages from `bat --list-languages`.
- Displays the full name of the language.
- Filters out languages that are probably config files (starts with an upper case letter).

## Caveats:

In order to properly parse the output of `bat --list-languages`, two conditions need to be met with the first language that appears in the list.

1. There is at least two spaces after the language name (i.e. is not the longest name).
2. The language name does not contain two consecutive spaces in it.

559,Prevent `--terminal-width=0` and invalid forms of `--terminal-width`.,"My proposed solution to #535, which involves validating `--terminal-width` to report an error if somebody provides a width of zero.

## Why this approach, and not having it disable wrapping?
User convenience is definitely something to consider, but in this instance I believe having `--terminal-width=0` being analogous to `--wrap=never` would be more of a quirky behaviour than a quality-of-life feature.

1. Having such a feature would dilute the meaning of `--terminal-width`.
2. Using `--terminal-width=0` as `--wrap=never` isn't very clear or intuitive.
3. Using `--terminal-width=0` as a way to disable wrapping results in a conflict when you don't want wrapping, but do want to specify a specific terminal width.
4. It's more explicit (and less characters) to type `--wrap=never`.",69,795,2019-05-09 01:17:40+00:00,2019-05-10 22:50:59+00:00,2019-05-10 22:51:06+00:00,2019-05-10 22:50:59+00:00,closed,True,6,3,12,0,1,12,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,sharkdp/bat

It turns out that I made a couple mistakes when initially implementing escape passthrough. This improved implementation is still making a few assumptions about the escape sequences (CSI/SGR sequences are safe to concatenate and use as a prefix, and all others are safe to pass through), but it should be a bit more reliable when fed any other sequences.

570,Add new style component to separate multiple '--line-range's,"My solution to my own issue, #569.

## Reasoning

When specifying multiple line ranges with `--line-range=... --line-range=...`, the printed lines tend to blend together and make it difficult to determine the scope of each range.

Example which makes parts of three functions look as though they're a single function:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32112321/58362966-60ebe080-7e52-11e9-867f-af6ed7996288.png)


## Implementation

The ""snip"" separator is implemented as another style component much like header and grid. I chose to include it in the `full` style by default, since doing otherwise would no longer make it ""full"".

When not using the `full` style, it can be added as `snip`.


## Preview

594,Improve SimplePrinter throughput,"bat performance is very slow for `loop_through` compared to native `cat`, which means I have to switch to `/bin/cat` for some tasks.

The reason it's so slow is that bat always reads line-by-line, even if the input is printed as-is (SimplePrinter). This PR addresses that problem by changing abstractions: Reading should be part of the Printers so we can use fast reading for `loop_through` workloads.

Note that the code probably has some weird stuff in it since I'n not very familiar with Rust and its ecosystem; also I didn't change the tests",32,549,2019-06-16 19:47:33+00:00,,2019-09-10 10:14:00+00:00,2019-09-10 10:14:00+00:00,closed,False,8,1,83,78,3,83,78,0,0,3,3,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,sharkdp/bat

> **Double-free and use-after-free in SmallVec::grow()**
> Attempting to call `grow` on a spilled SmallVec with a value equal to the current capacity causes it to free the existing data. This performs a double free immediately and may lead to use-after-free on subsequent accesses to the SmallVec contents.

673,Parameterized documentation.,"Fixes #659.

Although it's slightly overkill, this uses Liquid for templating.
It's a well-tested templating engine, and it shouldn't break anytime soon.

## Changes
- The manual page has been moved from `doc/bat.1` to `assets/manual/bat.1.in`
- The fish completion file has been moved from `assets/completions/bat.fish` to `assets/completions/bat.fish.in`
- The generated files have been added to the `.gitignore`.
  Keeping them in the repo is redundant, and it will discourage people from copying them directly from GitHub.

## Information
Certain information is now parameterized using environment variables:

- `PROJECT_NAME` -- Set this to change the project name (default: `bat`).
- `PROJECT_EXECUTABLE` -- Set this to change the executable name (in documentation only; default: value of `PROJECT_NAME`).

## Caveats
The executable name can't be changed from an environment variable.
For this reason, I'm also keeping the generated files as `bat.*`.

If any of the files need to be renamed when packaging, it should be done in an external packaging script.",28,1084,2019-09-27 19:38:02+00:00,2019-09-29 01:58:36+00:00,2019-09-29 01:58:36+00:00,2019-09-29 01:58:36+00:00,closed,True,1,5,458,88,8,458,88,1,1,6,6,3,7,7,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,sharkdp/bat

##### Project Structure
Cargo has a convention where [other executables can be placed in src/bin/*.rs][pkg-layout]. This PR use that convention which move some `src/*.rs` that depend on `app.rs`, `clap_app.rs`, _or_ clap crate into `src/bin/bat`. Summary, the src directory became:

```console

693,Library updates,"work in progress... (a follow up on #679)

**To do** before we can release `bat`-as-a-library:

- [x] Move the `dirs` module to the binary. This involves a restructuring of the `assets` module. For the library, it would first be enough to only provide the cached assets (`HighlightingAssets::new()`).
- [x] Possibly move the error-handling to the binary (the `handle_error` function). We don't want the library to print `[bat error]: …`. Instead, we could pass a callback to the `Controller`.
- [x] The public API interface is huge at the moment. We should try to minimize this by making things private. Otherwise, we will have lots of (technically) API-breaking changes in the future.

707,Add delta to related projects,"@sharkdp This PR adds my project  [delta](https://github.com/dandavison/delta) to the list of related projects.

Delta is related to bat in that it honors `BAT_PAGER`, and it uses exactly the same mechanism of including binary syntax and theme definition files (In fact, the delta README instructs users to use bat to create new versions of these files), and I plan to add support for reading custom syntax/theme files from `~/.cache/bat` (https://github.com/dandavison/delta/issues/19). Indeed, delta copies some of your code to do this! I plan to investigate whether I can avoid some of the copying by using bat's new library architecture.

Also, when I first heard of bat and that it had git integration, one thing I wondered was whether bat would syntax-highlight diffs sections according to their language. So it may also make sense to list delta as a related project on the basis that others may have the same thought.

837,Add issue templates and a `info.sh` tool for helping collect and report system info.,"The shell script is intended to be used to help maintainers and contributors diagnose issues that other people are having with `bat` and/or integration with external tools.

It asks for consent to collect data, and will print the following if everything is allowed:

```
========== system ==========

+ uname -srm
Darwin 18.7.0 x86_64

+ sw_vers # or lab_release on Linux
ProductName:	Mac OS X
ProductVersion:	10.14.6
BuildVersion:	18G95

========== bat ==========

+ bat --version
bat 0.12.1

+ env
BAT_PAGER=
PAGER=/usr/local/bin/less

========== bat_config ==========

+ cat /Users/eth-p/.config/bat/config
--tabs 4

# Syntaxes
#--map-syntax From:to


========== bat_wrapper ==========

+ cat /Users/eth-p/.local/bin/bat
#!/usr/bin/env bash

esac
ARGS+=(""$@"")

exec /usr/local/bin/bat ""${ARGS[@]}""


========== tool ==========

+ less --version
less 530 (PCRE regular expressions)
```

The data collected is as follows:

- Kernel name and version.
- Operating system details (distro, release name).
- `bat` version
- `less` version
- `bat` environment variables.
- `bat` config file.
- Any wrapper script ~~(but not function)~~ around `bat`.

```
--map-syntax <glob-pattern>:<syntax-name>

(this is a breaking change, users will have to adapt their config files)

This PR also adds a builtin database of syntax mappings to `bat` to handle cases such as:

* Glob-based lookups for paths:
  * `/proc/cpuinfo` => `CpuInfo syntax`
  * `**/.ssh/config` => `SSHConfig`
  * `/etc/profile` => `Bash`
  * `*.h` => `C++` (I assume this is a better default than ""Objective C"")
* Files named `build` are no longer mapped to ""NAnt Build File"" (which should only match `*.build` files). Instead, we use the first-line detection mechanism on such files.

When depending on bat as a library, downstream Cargo.toml should disable this feature to cut out inapplicable heavy dependencies like liquid.

```toml
[dependencies]
bat = { version = ""0.13"", default-features = false }
```

I've put some other optional functionality behind features as well: paging and git support, neither of which I would want for cargo-expand.",38,517,2020-03-30 17:48:20+00:00,2020-03-31 07:27:57+00:00,2020-03-31 08:08:55+00:00,2020-03-31 07:27:57+00:00,closed,True,12,4,148,109,20,148,109,0,0,20,20,4,3,3,0,0,0,0,20,0,0,sharkdp/bat
900,"Update to syntect 4.1, fancy-regex support","This PR updates the `syntect` dependency to 4.1.

It also adds a `regex-onig` feature (enabled for the application) and a `regex-fancy` feature, which can be enabled to use `fancy-regex` as an engine in `syntect`.

With this change, applications which depend on `bat` as a library, can use
``` toml
[dependencies.bat]
version = ""…""
default-features = false
features = [""regex-fancy""]
```
to remove the `onig` dependency. The full dependency tree after this update is attached below.

One problem that has not yet been resolved is the included set of syntaxes, which is *not* fully compatible with `regex-fancy` (due to regex rewriting, as described in the [syntect 4.0 release notes](https://github.com/trishume/syntect/releases/tag/v4.0.0)) because it has been built with a version of `bat` that uses `regex-onig`. Fixing this would probably require us to
* build two versions of `bat` (`bat-onig` and `bat-fancy`)
* Adapt `assets/create.sh` to run `bat cache --build …` with both versions, creating two different binary dumps
* Adapt `assets.rs` to read the respective binary, depending on the chosen feature:

https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/blob/3355aeba22948df238c1f7a4495b01e3bcb2bc81/src/assets.rs#L96-L98

Unfortunately, that is currently not possible (with the full syntax set), due to https://github.com/trishume/syntect/issues/287

<h2>Fixes to errors</h2>
<ul>
<li>Make sure errors implement <code>Send</code> <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/trishume/syntect/pull/285"">#285</a></li>
<li>Fix errors to not use the deprecated <code>description()</code> <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/trishume/syntect/pull/286"">#286</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks <a href=""https://github.com/sharkdp"">@sharkdp</a> for the bug fixes! Bumping second part of semver since <code>Send</code> is adding functionality (back).</p>
<h2>Pure-Rust regex engine support!</h2>
<h3>Headline feature: pure-Rust <code>fancy-regex</code> engine option</h3>
<p>Users can now opt in to a pure-Rust regex engine using Cargo features, making
compilation easier in general. People experiencing difficulty compiling for
Windows and Wasm should try switching to <code>fancy-regex</code>. Note this currently
approximately halves highlighting speed.</p>
<p>See the Readme and <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/trishume/syntect/pull/270"">#270</a> for details.
Thanks to <a href=""https://github.com/robinst"">@robinst</a> for implementing this!</p>
<h3>Other changes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ability to generate CSS for a theme for use with classed HTML generation (won't always be correct) <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/trishume/syntect/pull/274/files"">#274</a></li>
<li>Don't generate empty spans in classed HTML <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/trishume/syntect/pull/276"">#276</a></li>
<li>Miscellaneous dependency bumps and cleanup</li>
</ul>
<h3>Breaking changes and upgrading</h3>
<p>Upgrading should cause no errors for nearly all users. Users using more unusual APIs may have a small amount of tweaking to do.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Edit March 30:</strong> If you generate custom pack files and want to use fancy-regex you need to regenerate them. The binary format is the same but at YAML loading time regex rewrites get applied that make fancy-regex work properly.</li>
<li>If you use <code>default-features = false</code> you may need to update your features to choose a regex engine</li>
<li>A bunch of technically public APIs that I don't know if anyone uses changed due to the regex engine refactor, common uses shouldn't break</li>

903,Factor out writing the output so it can be used in a lib,"Hey!

This PR is largely just moving the actual reading/writing logic into a separate function that takes a writer. Going along with the librarizing theme, this allows other libraries to cleanly capture and use the output. I added an example for how this might be used.

I'm not a huge fan of the error handling, but didn't see any better options. It looks like for multiple files, we don't let a single file fail the whole operation. Given that, we can't use standard `Result`s.

I also didn't make with/default error_handler variants. I figure this is a library, people can just pass in the default (it is public, after all). I didn't want to create even more function-nesting.

Let me know what you think -",56,717,2020-04-02 07:08:04+00:00,,2020-06-01 07:55:00+00:00,2020-06-01 07:55:00+00:00,closed,False,3,4,49,4,2,49,4,1,0,1,1,2,1,1,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,sharkdp/bat

913,Add script to find slow-to-highlight files,"This PR adds a script that goes through all languages that are supported by 'bat'. For each language, it loops over the correspoinding file extensions and searches a given folder for matching files. It calls 'bat' for each of these files and measures the highlighting speed (number of characters per second). The script reports files which lead to slow highlighting speeds or errors during the execution of 'bat'.

Here are some results:

- I found a couple of C# `*.cs` files. This was expected and will be fixed in the next release (see #677)
- I found a couple of `*.gemspec` and `*.rake` files (Ruby) which lead to a panic. This is a minified example:
  ```ruby
  <<END_DESC
  Test
  END_DESC
  ```
  Apparently, there is a problem with heredocs in the Ruby syntax: https://github.com/sublimehq/Packages/blob/f36b8f807d5f30d2b8ef639232a9fc5960f550fa/Ruby/Ruby.sublime-syntax#L4-L17
  (note how GitHub also highlights this incorrectly)

  Nevertheless, we obviously shouldn't panic here:
  ```
  thread 'main' panicked at 'regex string should be pre-tested: Error(-208, invalid backref number/name)', /home/shark/.cargo/registry/src/github.com-1ecc6299db9ec823/syntect-4.1.0/src/parsing/regex.rs:70:17
  ```
  For some reason, this was not caught when creating the syntax binary dump where the regex should have been pretested. The offending regex is `^\1$`. Bug ticket: #914 
- I found a `*.vue` file that leads to a panic:
  ```
  thread 'main' panicked at 'Can only call resolve on linked references: ByScope { scope: <source.stylus>, sub_context: None }', /home/shark/.cargo/registry/src/github.com-1ecc6299db9ec823/syntect-4.1.0/src/parsing/syntax_definition.rs:188:18
  ```
  The minified example looks like this:
  ``` vue
  <style lang=""stylus"">
  </style>
  ```

So far, we would print ANSI escape codes like

which require a terminal with 256 color support.

With this change, we use [""4-bit"" codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#3/4_bit)
```
\x1b[__m
```
like `\x1b[31m` for ""red"". 

There is no change for the `ansi-dark` and `ansi-light` themes.

Unfortunately, `ansi_term` does not support ""bright"" versions of these colors (see table [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#3/4_bit)). We currently fall back to the non-bright versions.

936,"PrettyPrint wrapper, custom 'Read' input, bugfixes, major refactoring","This is a major update of *""bat as a library""*. I have implemented a new `PrettyPrinter` struct which is a builder-like wrapper to configure and control the pretty-printing process. I tried to make it similar to [`prettyprint::PrettyPrinter`](https://docs.rs/prettyprint/0.8.1/prettyprint/struct.PrettyPrinter.html) by @mre, but it will not be a drop-in replacement, unfortunately.

**Major new functionality**: the `bat` library can now accept arbitrary `Read`ers as input. This also includes input from a (byte) string.

Here are a few examples of how the library can be used (see `examples` folder for more):

#### `simple.rs`

``` rust
/// A simple program that prints its own source code using the bat library
use bat::PrettyPrinter;

fn main() {
    PrettyPrinter::new().input_file(file!()).print().unwrap();
}

#### `cat.rs`
``` rust
/// A very simple colorized `cat` clone, using `bat` as a library.
/// See `src/bin/bat` for the full `bat` application.
use bat::PrettyPrinter;

#### `yaml.rs`
``` rust
/// A program that serializes a Rust structure to YAML and pretty-prints the result
use bat::PrettyPrinter;
use serde::Serialize;

#[derive(Serialize)]
struct Person {
    name: String,

This should help with diagnosing any current and future issues when `bat` was installed through the Debian repository.",46,271,2020-05-02 08:19:57+00:00,2020-05-02 08:39:59+00:00,2020-05-02 08:40:00+00:00,2020-05-02 08:40:00+00:00,closed,True,0,3,56,14,1,56,14,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,sharkdp/bat
972,"Fix base16, and combine 00 and 0f alpha encodings","This changes the base16 theme back from #RRGGBB**0f** to #RRGGBB**00**,
reverting part of #934. That PR used the 0f encoding to produce ANSI
escape sequences 30-37 and 40-47 rather than 38;5 and 48;5 which require
256-color support. Unfortunately, it resulted in base16 using the wrong
colors because ansi_term does not support the bright variants (90-97 and
100-107) so it simply mapped them to the non-bright colors.

This PR makes combines the 00 and 0f alpha encodings into 00, and makes
them use the Color enum for the first 8 colors and Fixed otherwise. This
means the ansi-light and ansi-dark themes will work on terminals without
256-color support, and base16 will render bright colors correctly.

985,"Unify syntax detection for all variants of InputKind, fix #983","This pull request adds a new `InputKind::String` along with `Input::from_string`, and changes a couple things to help fix potential issues and improve the expected syntax detection behavior of `InputKind::CustomReader`/String.

## Additions:
- Adds `InputKind::String` and `Input::from_string` to create files from strings. Currently, this is `pub(crate)` visibility since it was originally added to improve tests. It should be fine to make it public, however.

## Changes:
- Changes the syntax detection behaviour of `InputKind::CustomReader` (and `String`) to work like the syntax detection for a regular file. I feel like `StdIn` should also follow suit, but I didn't want to introduce any significant breaking changes to the CLI in this pull request.

## Fixes:
- Fixes #983 by using `InputKind::String`, so the test files never touch the filesystem. This should also preemptively fix future testing issues related to invalid or unsupported UTF-8 on certain filesystems.",62,983,2020-05-12 03:19:24+00:00,2020-05-15 20:57:45+00:00,2020-05-15 21:01:36+00:00,2020-05-15 20:57:45+00:00,closed,True,20,10,139,33,5,139,33,1,0,4,4,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,sharkdp/bat

997,"Allow 'bat' application to built without git feature, remove PrettyPrint git support when feature not enabled.","This pull request changes two things:

1. *(bat-as-a-library; breaking change)*
When the `git` feature is not enabled, it removes `PrettyPrinter::vcs_modification_markers`. This function was previously being exposed when the feature was disabled, despite not having any effect when used.

2. *(bat)*
Adds `cfg` flags to allow the `bat` application to build without requiring the `git` feature. This would allow people to build `bat` without git support if they don't feel they would need or use it.

This PR adds syntax highlighting support for SML (Standard ML).

**Guideline Criteria:**
https://packagecontrol.io/packages/SML%20(Standard%20ML) (16k installs)

**Notes:**
The upstream syntax was originally in `tmLanguage` format, which I've converted to a `.sublime-syntax` file, along with removing `ml` as a filetype that it attempts to highlight as it's my understanding that this could conflict with existing rules for OCaml. As such, I've not included it as a submodule, though if this is undesirable, I can amend as necessary.

1111,Add new theme: base16-256,"See #1033 for the discussion that led to this.

In summary, the base16 theme introduced in #543 works great for users who configure their terminals with the [base16 system](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16) in which the 16 ANSI colors are repurposed as base16 palette slots. But it doesn't work for users of [base16-shell](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-shell), which aims to solve problems with base16-unaware software by leaving the bright colors (ANSI 8-15) alone, and instead using codes 16-21 for extra base16 palette slots (requiring a 256-color terminal, hence base16-256).

Here is how terminal themes for [regular base16](https://github.com/kdrag0n/base16-kitty/blob/master/templates/default.mustache) and [256-color/base16-shell](https://github.com/kdrag0n/base16-kitty/blob/master/templates/default-256.mustache) differ:

| ANSI code | base16 | base16-256 |
|---|---|---|
| 08 | base03 | base03 |
| 09 | **base09** | base08 |
| 10 | **base01** | base0B |
| 11 | **base02** | base0A |
| 12 | **base04** | base0D |
| 13 | **base06** | base0E |
| 14 | **base0F** | base0C |
| 15 | base07 | base07 |
| 16 | | **base09** |
| 17 | | **base0F** |
| 18 | | **base01** |
| 19 | | **base02** |
| 20 | | **base04** |
| 21 | | **base06** |

Notice codes 08 (bright black) and 15 (bright white) stay the same. But 09 (bright red) through 14 (bright cyan) are replaced with their non-bright counterparts, and those base16 colors are moved to ANSI codes 16-21.

So the new base16-256 theme is just like base16, but makes the following replacements:

- base09 goes from ANSI 09 to 16: `#09000000` → `#10000000`
- base01 goes from ANSI 10 to 18: `#0a000000` → `#12000000`
- base02 goes from ANSI 11 to 19: `#0b000000` → `#13000000`
- base04 goes from ANSI 12 to 20: `#0c000000` → `#14000000`
- base06 goes from ANSI 13 to 21: `#0d000000` → `#15000000`
- base0F goes from ANSI 14 to 17: `#0e000000` → `#11000000`

terminal.rs already maps any `#RR000000` to the 256-color code `RR`, so no code change is needed.

Here is what base16 and base16-256 look like on macOS, kitty terminal with [https://github.com/kdrag0n/base16-kitty/blob/master/colors/base16-solarized-light-256.conf](base16-solarized-light-256.conf), and fish shell with [base16-shell/profile_helper.fish](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-shell/blob/master/profile_helper.fish) sourced:

![Screen Shot 2020-07-19 at 5 22 08 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/316673/87885479-6310e700-c9e4-11ea-83fe-8d579349a2dc.png)

It's not so obvious in this example, but in this theme constants like `2.0` are supposed to be orange, not red. The base16 theme shows red because it's using ANSI bright red (which is just plain red in the 256-color terminal theme). The base16-256 theme correctly shows it as orange because it instead uses ANSI code 16.

1121,Completely move CI/CI to GitHub Actions,"This PR is intended to fully move our CI/CD from Travis/AppVeyor to GitHub actions.

Change log / to do:
- [x] Disable code coverage comments
- [x] Remove unneeded `*-i586-*` platforms (reduce chance of failure and number of Downloads on the release page)
- [x] Remove Travis, AppVeyor settings and `ci` folder.
- [x] Add (Fish) autocompletion files to Archives and Debian packages
- [x] Add full `copyright` text and Debian `control` file to package file, see: https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/blob/75246fb25b1e68724d636861d24ffa39845c58f2/ci/before_deploy.bash#L60-L177
- [x] Add special job to run
  ```bash
  cargo install --release
  bash assets/create.sh
  cargo test --release # '--release' because we could prevent another full recompile
  ```
  The `bash assets/create.sh` script is something that I typically run prior to a new release. It uses the installed `bat` to build a binary cache of syntaxes and themes. The subsequent run of `cargo test` will then use these new binary caches.
  Quite a lot of tests depend on the builtin set of syntaxes, so this special run would be very valuable in catching bugs/inconsistencies in the syntax additions early.
- [x] Check all feature combinations, see:  https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/blob/75246fb25b1e68724d636861d24ffa39845c58f2/ci/script.bash#L16-L20",39,1323,2020-08-02 10:55:47+00:00,2020-08-02 19:51:25+00:00,2020-08-02 19:51:33+00:00,2020-08-02 19:51:25+00:00,closed,True,1,18,167,455,9,167,455,1,7,1,1,3,4,4,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,sharkdp/bat

1123,Ignore 'more' on pager,"A couple things:
1. There's probably a terser syntax for this. I'd love to see it, I'm still learning Rust.
2. Depending on the desired behavior this may or may not be sufficient. When specifying ""more"" the fall-over to None means the default ""less"" will be used. This is in contrast to if you specify, say, ""More"" where bat will just disable paging.

But since #1035, some of the output is appearing in the form `Lang ext, *.ext`.
For instance in the C++ entry of `bat --list-languages`, containing both `h` and `*.h`:

```
...
C++                                 cpp, cc, cp, cxx, c++, C, h, hh, hpp, hxx, h++, inl, ipp, *.h

```
and likewise 

```

F#                                   fs, fsi, fsx, *.fs
...
JavaScript (Babel)                   js, mjs, jsx, babel, es6, cjs, *.js

1137,Nginx and Apache config file syntax highlighting,"Closes #1107

Hey, I picked this issue to get into `bat`. I added a submodule to the [GitHub repo of the linked syntax highlighting file](https://github.com/brandonwamboldt/sublime-nginx). I tried it out with the example from [the nginx wiki](https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/examples/full/) and worked as expected.

For Apache, I converted the linked `.tmLanguage` file, but the highlighting is not correct yet (closing tag names are not colored). I am still looking into that, but I wanted to open the pull request early.

That said, thanks for creating `bat`, I use it every day!

1141,Added new alias for 'decoration=always',"This PR addresses #1108 .

Hey all, first time making a PR for a rust repo and still pretty new to it.

Think I addressed the feature here for adding an alias for `--decoration=always` with the `-D` arg. The `-D` commands works the same as if `--decoration=always` or if running on a terminal that can support decorations (e.g- `--decoration=auto`)

Adds a new style argument `rule` (open to bikeshedding on the name), which adds a simple horizontal ruled line between files.

This line takes the place of padding (an empty line) that would otherwise be added anyway to delimit files, and is the same color as the grid style.

A couple of questions I had while implementing this:

- Should this style component be enabled by the `full` argument? This PR does not make it enabled by the `full` argument, becuase:
  - I don't think it is semantically correct (in my mind, `rule` is a subset of `grid` already)
  - it looks horrible
  - it would be a breaking change
- ~The snapshot tests do not cover the case of printing multiple files - should they?~
  - ~Currently, coverage of this new feature and the existing feature of `bat` delimiting files with whitespace is not covered. Happy to update the tests to cover this case, but it would probably be better in it's own PR?~
  - It's covered in the integration tests, added a new case there

1294,Make logo compatible with light and dark themes,"Hi there! 👋

Thanks for bat! I use it on a daily basis, whenever I want to see any highlighted content. Be it source code, markup — or things like those nowadays endless yaml files.

So, I thought this would be a nice project to contribute to; being something I use! Maybe I can give something back.

This is how this PR happened. As I am [learning Rust](https://github.com/scorphus/advent-of-code-2018), I though I could take a stab at contributing to some Rust project in the wild. After digging the realms of my memory, bat popped up. Already late into the evening, I openned the repo. Scrolled down a bit. And it appeared! The wide, shiny, white ribbon:

![bat-logo-before](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2112697/95507890-6cda3300-09b2-11eb-966f-3ef50817f7ea.png)

Being shortsighted and therefore a fierce adopter of dark themes, my eyes hurt with that glare. My immediate thought was ""that's something I can fix! I can change the logo in a way to make it dark-theme-friendly without affecting its appearance in GitHub's default theme.""

Luckily, it's an SVG. I started experimenting a bit by manually changing the opacity and shade of that *whitish* rectangle. I tried a [bunch of different combinations](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2015&gist=edba3ad5c615fd9ee0992aa81960110d) of opacities and shades, narrowing them down to a few and finally sticking with `opacity:0.25` and `fill:#cbcbcb`, as they look good on a dark background — besides `0.25` being a “nice” number:

![bat-logo-after](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2112697/95507974-8ed3b580-09b2-11eb-9c92-2f2de4c18e4b.png)

The final result can be visualized in my fork: https://github.com/scorphus/bat/tree/logo-dark-theme

If you or any other fellow developer think that another combination out of the [241 remaining](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2015&gist=edba3ad5c615fd9ee0992aa81960110d) looks better than that one, I'm more than happy to consider it 😊",47,2027,2020-10-08 21:42:07+00:00,2020-10-14 06:15:09+00:00,2020-10-14 12:56:38+00:00,2020-10-14 06:15:09+00:00,closed,True,14,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,sharkdp/bat

1296,Set line endings for batch files to LF for syntax-tests,"I tried to fix the outgoing change in `highlighted/Batch/build.bat` after running `update.sh`, and as you mentioned in https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/pull/1289#issuecomment-705490210, the source file has CRLF line endings too.

But it looks like this is a git thing, git always commits .bat files with CRLF (because it looks like they don't run correctly with LF line endings, and while we don't want to run these syntax-test files, git doesn't know that). And whatever I tried to make git ignore this and just commit these files with only LF, it ignored all of my tries and just converts the file back to CRLF (`warning: LF will be replaced by CRLF in tests/syntax-tests/highlighted/Batch/build.bat`).

So I started comparing the generated files on a binary level and saw that the difference is only the last newline. The commited file has CRLF as every newline, but after running the `update.sh` the last newline was only a LF. So I changed the `create_highlighted_versions.py` script to replace that last newline with a CRLF which is what git would do too. That way the script always already generates the file git already knows, so it doesn't show an outgoing change after running `update.sh`.

This maybe isn't the best solution, but as said, everything else I tried didn't work. If somebody has a better solution, I'm open for feedback. The alternative would be to just ignore this, because when trying to commit the outgoing change it just disappears, but I still think it's confusing because it's showing an outgoing change I wouldn't expect when running `update.sh`. :shrug:

1398,Bring back clircle,"Closes #1193

After #1396, the cycle detection introduced originally in #1197 was reverted again. Clircle has been updated to behave as expected and may now be pulled back in.

The two commits are the same changes as in #1197, only the version number and lock file are different. I quickly tried to implement an integration test for the problem from #1396, but that didn't work. I don't know how to mock stdio in a way that clircle conceives them as a tty, so that the new behavior can be tested.

Maybe this functionality should be a compilation feature that is enabled by default, so that in case some dependency of clircle breaks or so, crates that depend on `bat` can opt out. Some users might want to opt out too.

Let me know what you think!

the fix is a bit rough in the edges (for example, I just discovered it has some rust linter clippy warnings), but before I polish it, I just wanted to check what you think about the overall approach?

Looking forward to your comments!

Great project btw!

1410,Add Clippy linter step to CICD,"Run the linter on the minimum supported rust version; otherwise we will
get lint warnings for things that require a too high Rust toolchain
version to fix.

Allow the following warnings, since we already have them our code:
- clippy::new-without-default
- clippy::match-bool
- clippy::if_same_then_else

Eventually we should fix these lint issues and then disallow them to
prevent them from coming back in other places.

The clippy args used is recommended here:
https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy#travis-ci

I noticed that my PR #1402 passed CICD checks despite having some lint issues, so I thought it would be a good idea to add a linter step to CICD.

I tested the new step in GitHub Actions over at my fork, and it seems to work. You can check here if you want: https://github.com/Enselic/bat/runs/1467487513?check_suite_focus=true (Please ignore my temp changes to CICD.yml to be able to make the test).

But of course it would be a good idea for you to make sure the new step works when triggered from this repo as well. I think you have to trigger it manually since I don't have permission to trigger new CI/CD steps in this repo (which makes sense for security reasons of course).

(I didn't add anything about this to CHANGELOG.md since the change does not affect the behavior of bat, as touched upon in CONTRIBUTING.md)

1412,Add ansi theme to replace ansi-light and ansi-dark,"Fixes #1104

Combines `ansi-light` and `ansi-dark` into a single theme `ansi`:

* Works for terminals with light or dark backgrounds.

* To request ""no color"", themes set the alpha component to 01, i.e. `#00000001`. This results in the terminal's default foreground/background color being used.

* Rather than specify ""no color"" in many places, the new ansi theme just sets theme's overall foreground/background colors.

    * Exception: We set the gutter color explicitly, since printer.rs falls back to `Fixed(238)` for themes with no gutter color.

* On theme lookup failure for `ansi-light` or `ansi-dark` (i.e. user has no custom theme with this name), prints a deprecation message and uses `ansi`.

    * I think this is preferable to copying/symlinking files since some users might have manual workarounds to switch between `ansi-light` and `ansi-dark`, and it would be good for them to learn this is no longer needed.

As usual, PR does not include themes.bin regeneration.

Here are screenshots from macOS Terminal.app's default theme in system light/dark mode:

1421,Remove repeated `contains` calls,"(I can edit changelog if you want, but this should result in no usage difference nor is it a bugfix)

## Background

First off thanks for the great program (not to mention the others you've made that I also use)! I've already recommended it to several of my friends.

So just to give some background I was using `bat` to read a file and pipe the info through some other programs. I was a bit confused why changes to the program weren't mattering when I finally realized that `bat` was limiting the throughput. I decided to see if there were any obvious changes that could help out, and from `cargo flamegraph` I saw a surprising amount of time in `HashSet` contains which I narrowed down to checking the styles for different values. Long story short it was being checked repeatedly in the hot loop leading to a significant amount of the runtime. Moving the check outside the loop yielded a decent performance increase and shouldn't have an impact on the program's behavior since the values shouldn't change while the program is displaying (at least AFAIK).

(Partially off topic, but does it really make sense to store the styles in a `HashSet`? I would think that a `Vec` would be faster unless there are going to be more styles than I would expect.)

## Potential Remaining Improvements

The other change that looks like it could be low hanging fruit would be modifying the line range checks since they now take up about ~10% of the runtime from `random.file` below. I think the behavior could be modified to boil down to determining the next time the range value will change ahead of time, but I haven't dug into it too much.

After that the vast majority of the time is spent either reading or writing. I've already read that you don't want to switch to a buffered writer for valid reasons. A large portion of the reading does seem to be taken up by checking for where the new-line using `read_until`. Nothing too notably really seemed to stick out from writing, it looks like stdout isn't locked from `OutputType`: however, my attempt locking it didn't seem to improve performance from what I could tell. Another possible way for improving throughput would be to move reading and writing into separate threads passing values over some `sync_channel`? It's possible that switching reading and writing to be async would essentially do this too? I'm not very familiar with async code if I'm being honest.

## Basic Benchmarks

All results run on my rather lightweight laptop. Linux 5.9.11, Intel i5-5200U @ 2.7GHz. I used three different 1GB files all in a tmpfs (I only have 8GB RAM total so that's pretty much my limit). `zero.file` is entirely `0x00` bytes, `random.file` is from `/dev/urandom`, and `controller_1gb.rs` is `controller.rs` duplicated till it was 1GB.

```txt
# Note this one caused a spike in memory usage due to extending the buffer to
# cover the whole file since there's no new line.
❯ ./bat_orig zero.file | pv > /dev/null
1.00GiB 0:00:02 [ 490MiB/s]

❯ ./bat_orig random.file | pv > /dev/null
1.00GiB 0:00:03 [ 272MiB/s]

❯ ./bat_orig controller_1gb.rs | pv > /dev/null
1.00GiB 0:00:25 [40.1MiB/s]
```

~10% of time from `random.file` is spent in `Hashset::contains`. The remaining time all looks to be from reading and writing.

```txt
❯ ./bat_less_hashing zero.file | pv > /dev/null
1.00GiB 0:00:02 [ 493MiB/s]

❯ ./bat_less_hashing random.file | pv > /dev/null
1.00GiB 0:00:03 [ 294MiB/s]

❯ ./bat_less_hashing controller_1gb.rs | pv > /dev/null
1.00GiB 0:00:23 [44.5MiB/s]
```

Essentially no change from `zero.file` as expected. The files that iterate through the loop more have a moderate improvement.

Note however, that using a pager such as less will add a newline itself.
So to actually not print a newline for such files, you need to either
disable paging:

1441,Add `-s`/`--squeeze` and `--squeeze-limit`.,"After some reconsideration towards #762, I decided to try adding support for `bat -s`.

While I personally think that having the option to squeeze empty lines goes against the Unix philosophy, `cat` itself has the feature on every distro (and even MacOS). For the sake of maintaining drop-in replacement compatibility, I added support to bat.

Another benefit of including it rather than relying on sed would be to show the correct line numbers in the sidebar.

This pull request adds:

- `bat --squeeze`/`bat -s`
- `bat --squeeze-limit=<number>` -- to set the maximum number of consecutive empty lines when using `-s`
- `PrettyPrinter::squeeze_empty_lines`

1444,Fix #1443 macOS: regression_test.sh: mktemp: illegal option,"The macOS version of mktemp does not recognize the --suffix option.
Using pure -d should work since, it seems [1], macOS 10.11 however.

So to make the script work on macOS, stop using the --suffix option.

The downside is of course that the temporary dir will have an anonymous
name, but I see no risk of confusion given how short-lived the usage of
the dir is, and given the context it is used.

I will not be offended if you disagree, but it is nice to keep things simple.

`Lean` is an [interactive theorem prover](https://leanprover-community.github.io/) with a decent sized user base (e.g. its Zulip has... around 3,000 folks idling in it). No users really use Sublime Text, the vast majority of its users use [VSCode](https://github.com/leanprover/vscode-lean), with a small subset using emacs (and an even smaller subset using other), so as I read it it likely doesn't meet the inclusion criteria, but just checking to be sure the above doesn't affect anything (it not really having any Sublime users).

explicitly allow (don't warn in the logs for) this category of clippy
lints.

1501,Also build Debian packages in PR CI workflow,"This PR makes Debian packages be built and published as artifacts for regular PR workflows.

It consists of four steps (commits) that can be code review individually together with respective commit message if the full diff is too confusing.

I think the only controversial change is the addition of `PROJECT_VERSION: ""0.17.1""`, but it is already duplicated a lot, and I could not figure out a way to parse it from Cargo.toml in the CI script that was less annoying than duplicating it another time. I am open for ideas though.

The reason we need to do it is that Debian packages can not be built without a version, and since a PR does not contain a version (unlike a tag) we need to use the Cargo.toml version. If we think it is too confusing to reuse the same version string for different builds, we could perhaps suffix the git SHA at the end, but personally I think that is not necessary at this stage.

This PR makes the following artifacts be built and uploaded for each PR:

```
bat-musl_0.17.1_amd64.deb
bat-musl_0.17.1_i686.deb
bat-v0.17.1-aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz

1518,Use more conservative circle detection,"Fixes #1503

This implements the exact logic for circle detection from `cat` for `bat`. To test this out yourself, you will have to get the newest version from the [pull request](https://github.com/niklasmohrin/clircle/pull/6) on the `clircle` repository and replace the `clircle` dependency in the `Cargo.toml` with the path to your local copy.

I will still have to fix the tests and see what to do with windows. Now that the posix approach (only error if program will provably fail later on) is taken here, we will have to investigate the situation on windows more closely.

I might still change things, there are breaking changes in `clircle` already, so there's no reason to hold back on changes over there.

Let me know, what you think and if you know anything about this on windows!

it.

Disclaimer: I put this in master in my fork, but it did not seem to work. I suspect it has to be in the mother project. From what I understand, this change should be enough to allow CICD piplines to be created manually, which is always useful.

1596,Improved ANSI passthrough.,"This pull request overhauls how `bat` interprets and re-emits ANSI escape sequences.
Prior to these changes, `bat` used a naiive heuristic that re-emits every encountered sequence on a new line. The encountered sequences are only cleared whenever the exact literal `\x1B[0m` is encountered.

In 60aad681f358fc7285ea72c77faa8782a060eab1, I added a simple ANSI sequence parser that only tracks the most recently-encountered ANSI SGR (color, style, etc.) sequence for each attribute. I haven't benchmarked the difference in CPU usage, but it significantly increases the performance of the pager (the cause of https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/issues/1481).

**Memory usage: (Top: before, Bottom: after)**

In 5aa94e8765e992cf669fcbb71a54ae8f5a57554c, I fixed ANSI passthrough support when wrapping is disabled. The non-wrapping branch didn't have code to handle ANSI, which led to inconsistencies across lines.

**Example: `printf '\x1B[33mYellow\nShould be yellow.\x1B[m' | bat --wrap=never`**

I did my best to manually check for any regressions, but I may have missed some. If anyone finds any issues with how ANSI is handled now, please let me know.

Additionally, if/when https://github.com/mitsuhiko/console/pull/95 is merged, we should update it. Without the fix, strings such as `\x1B(0lqk` will be incorrectly interpreted as [`\x1B(0l`, `qk`] instead of [`\x1B(0`, `lqk`].

I'm happy to update this if someone can suggest locations for either platform.

There was also discussion about making the path configurable for package maintainers. I had a look in `build.rs` but it wasn't clear how to feed through into the binary. Can you provide guidance on how that would be done?

1597,Add support for LESSOPEN and LESSCLOSE.,"This pull request adds opt-in support for preprocessors using the `LESSOPEN` and `LESSCLOSE` environment variables.

To enable the preprocessor, `--preprocessor=lessopen` must be set either be passed as a command line argument or set in the config file. This was made opt-in to avoid breaking default installations that provide an incompatible `LESSOPEN` program.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32112321/112308519-781ed380-8c5f-11eb-997a-4da2ad7b809b.png)

When used with something like `lesspipe.sh`, this can potentially fix #237, #642, #748, and #971.


## Implementation (Preprocessor Abstraction)

The preprocessor implementation is basically a `map` operation on `Input<'a> -> OpenedInput<'a>`.
It can either open the source input and return that directly (e.g. nothing to be done), or create a new `Input<'a>` and return that instead.

Preprocessors (or inputs like `InputKind::StdIn`) can attach ""handles"" to `OpenedInput<'a>` structs.
Handles can be used to perform cleanup actions (like deleting temporary files), or in the case of `InputKind::StdIn`, used to (`unsafe`ly) keep a reference to a `Stdin` object alive as long as its corresponding `InputReader`.

Note: handles will either be closed automatically when dropped (panicking on errors), or explicitly closed with `OpenedInput::close`.

## Implementation (Lessopen)

Using the new preprocessor abstraction, basic `LESSOPEN`/`LESSCLOSE` support was added to `bat`.
**Note:** This only supports file inputs.

1. If `LESSOPEN` is defined and invalid (as determined by `shell_words::split`), `bat` will silently do nothing.
  This doesn't follow the behavior of `less`, but it's more consistent with how `bat` handles the pager.

2. If `LESSOPEN` is defined but the process could not be spawned, `bat` will print a warning.
  For consistency with `less` (which simply ignores the exit code), this does not include the exit code of an unsuccessfully-exited command.

3. If `LESSOPEN` is defined and starts with `""|""`, `bat` will use its standard output as the preprocessed file contents.
  If no output is provided by the LESSOPEN function, `bat` will use the original file.

4.  If `LESSOPEN` is defined and does not start with `""|""`, `bat` will read the first line of output as the path to a temporary file containing the preprocessed file contents.

5. If any preprocessor command was executed and `LESSCLOSE` is defined, `bat` will execute `LESSCLOSE`.
  If the process could not be spawned, `bat` will print a warning.


## Caveats

- Git changes will be displayed with LESSOPEN, even if it outputs something different than the original file.
  This is intentional, and it's an unfortunate side-effect of the way that `lesspipe.sh` will always `cat` the file, even if it doesn't need to preprocess it.
  Without this, git changes would not be displayed at all.

- Due to some rewrites with the `input` module in order to add support for preprocessors, two instances of `unsafe` were added. 
  - A comment with safety information was included.

- It is not 100% compatible with `less`'s implementation.
  - This implementation tries to avoid invoking the user's shell, which limits the support to a shell-quoted list of arguments.
  - This implementation only replaces substitutes `%s` if it is an entire argument. Something like `LESSOPEN='| echo File:%s'` will not work.

- No tests were added. I couldn't think of a way to add tests without writing to the filesystem.",39,3511,2021-03-24 12:17:49+00:00,,2021-10-02 20:48:09+00:00,2021-10-02 20:48:09+00:00,closed,False,2,5,649,79,14,649,79,0,0,14,14,2,4,4,0,0,0,0,14,0,0,sharkdp/bat

Note: https://github.com/sublimehq/Packages/issues/1036#issuecomment-308998132 isn't officially standardised yet, so we might need to update the color schemes we use to cater for the `markup.error` and `markup.warning` scopes, potentially just by covering them in the existing `invalid.illegal` and `invalid.deprecated` rules (which I've done for Monokai by updating the patch) ... But, the good news is that the LSP plugin for Sublime Text is making use of them already, so many actively maintained color schemes likely should already highlight them or will soon if they don't already. :) ",48,731,2021-04-04 19:48:25+00:00,2021-05-12 20:22:51+00:00,2021-05-12 20:27:24+00:00,2021-05-12 20:22:51+00:00,closed,True,1,7,224,5,10,224,5,6,1,3,3,6,6,7,0,0,0,0,10,0,0,sharkdp/bat
1617,[Research] Add toxicity detection pipeline,"## Did you ever consider the addition of a toxicity detection bot to this project? 

We’re Nathan Cassee and Alexander Serebrenik (Eindhoven University of Technology, The Netherlands), Nicole Novielli (University of Bari, Italy), Christian Kastner (Carnegie Mellon University, USA), and Bogdan Vasilescu (Carnegie Mellon University, USA). And we are conducting research to understand the effectiveness of toxicity detection bots on GitHub. As part of our research we want to understand the impact of a state of the art toxicity detection bot in your project. We hope that a better knowledge and understanding of how these toxicity bots operate can be used to further improve the health of open-source projects.

To participate in this experiment we ask you to adopt a toxicity bot in sharkdp/bat. You can adopt the bot by merging this pull-request. This bot will monitor issues and pull-requests for comments containing toxicity, and will post a comment if it detects toxicity. Additionally, the bot will securely store comments and edits or deletions made to those comments. This will allow us to study the frequency of toxic comments, and whether and how toxic comments are edited or deleted.

We expect that the toxicity bot reduces toxicity in issues or in pull-requests. However, there might be cases where the bot responds in issues or pull-requests where there is no toxicity (a false positive) and this might distract on-topic discussions. 

## Practicalities

Your participation in this study is completely voluntary, at any point in time you can retract your project from this study. This can be done by disabling the toxicity bot, or by sending us an email. Additionally, if you don’t want us to use the results of your project in the analysis of the study, you can always email us to inform us that you want to retract your data from the study. 

The study itself will run for roughly three months, at the end of this time we will open a PR in your project to remove the toxicity bot from the project. If after the experiment you want to keep using the toxicity bot we can also provide you with a version of the toxicity bot that does not record telemetry. 

The data collected for this study will be stored securely on a private server, and the raw data will only be available to the researchers involved in this study. When we release or publicize results of the study the results will be released anonymously or in an aggregated way. 

This study has been approved by the Ethical Review Board of the Eindhoven University of Technology.

## Closing and Survey

If you have any questions about the bot feel free to ask them here, or mail them to n.w.cassee@tue.nl. 

If you are not interested in participating we would really appreciate it if you would let us know why you are not participating. 

Secondly, it would be really helpful if everyone involved in the project could respond to the following survey on your expectations of the bot, especially if you are not interested in adopting the bot (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeSkldbDUnsSgpjbMSa0WiIimD-0r6TErenRrVidK1j7wB10A/viewform)!

This pull request was created by Dependabot Preview, and you've upgraded to Dependabot. This means it won't respond to `dependabot` commands nor will it be automatically closed if a new version is found.

If you close this pull request, Dependabot will re-create it the next time it checks for updates and everything will work as expected.

1654,Add support for dash shebang,"Hello, everyone, first-timer here!

This is a patch to `Bash.sublime-syntax` that adds support for shebangs explicitly calling for `dash`, e.g., `#!/usr/bin/env dash`.

This is my first time contributing to any project, so I have a couple of questions that may be obvious:
- In `CONTRIBUTING.md` it is mentioned that one should update the `CHANGELOG`. This is done _after_ a pull request is merged, right? Is it a second, separate pull request?
- Should I add test files (#1213) with dash shebangs, or is it redundant given that this uses the existing Bash syntax file?

I have also prepared a second patch that adds support for XAML files (#1590), but I will wait for feedback on this before submitting another pull request in case I am doing something wrong.

Thank you for your incredible work! I look forward to trying to help out in the future, hopefully with a little bit of Rust!",28,896,2021-05-14 17:32:03+00:00,2021-05-15 08:33:23+00:00,2021-05-16 11:21:03+00:00,2021-05-15 08:33:23+00:00,closed,True,7,4,881,2,5,881,2,3,0,2,2,3,2,3,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,sharkdp/bat

1668,Remaining syntax highlighting test files,"The task list in #1213 has 18 unchecked languages; however, 2 of them already have test files:
- [Ruby Haml](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/tree/master/tests/syntax-tests/source/Ruby%20Haml)
- [syslog](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/tree/master/tests/syntax-tests/source/Syslog)

This adds the 16 remaining syntax test files, completing the collection in #1213!

I am not familiar with most of these languages, but I tried my best to pick files that had relatively varied syntax without being terribly long. We can always improve the test files in the future but it's good to have something for now.

<p><em>Sourced from <a href=""https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md"">nix's changelog</a>.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<h2>[0.21.0] - 31 May 2021</h2>
<h3>Added</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added <code>getresuid</code> and <code>getresgid</code>
(#<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1430"">1430</a>)</li>
<li>Added TIMESTAMPNS support for linux
(#<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1402"">1402</a>)</li>
<li>Added <code>sendfile64</code> (#<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1439"">1439</a>)</li>
<li>Added <code>MS_LAZYTIME</code> to <code>MsFlags</code>
(#<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1437"">1437</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Changed</h3>
<ul>
<li>Made <code>forkpty</code> unsafe, like <code>fork</code>
(#<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1390"">1390</a>)</li>
<li>Made <code>Uid</code>, <code>Gid</code> and <code>Pid</code> methods <code>from_raw</code> and <code>as_raw</code> a <code>const fn</code>
(#<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1429"">1429</a>)</li>
<li>Made <code>Uid::is_root</code> a <code>const fn</code>
(#<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1429"">1429</a>)</li>
<li><code>AioCb</code> is now always pinned.  Once a <code>libc::aiocb</code> gets sent to the kernel,
its address in memory must not change.  Nix now enforces that by using
<code>std::pin</code>.  Most users won't need to change anything, except when using
<code>aio_suspend</code>.  See that method's documentation for the new usage.
(#<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1440"">1440</a>)</li>
<li><code>LioCb</code> is now constructed using a distinct <code>LioCbBuilder</code> struct.  This
avoids a soundness issue with the old <code>LioCb</code>.  Usage is similar but
construction now uses the builder pattern.  See the documentation for
details.
(#<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1440"">1440</a>)</li>
<li>Minimum supported Rust version is now 1.41.0.
(<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1440"">#1440</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fixed</h3>
<ul>
<li>Allow <code>sockaddr_ll</code> size, as reported by the Linux kernel, to be smaller then it's definition
(#<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1395"">1395</a>)</li>
<li>Fix spurious errors using <code>sendmmsg</code> with multiple cmsgs
(#<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1414"">1414</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Removed</h3>
<ul>
<li>Removed <code>sys::socket::accept4</code> from Android arm because libc removed it in
version 0.2.87.
(<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1399"">#1399</a>)</li>
<li><code>AioCb::from_boxed_slice</code> and <code>AioCb::from_boxed_mut_slice</code> have been
removed.  They were useful with earlier versions of Rust, but should no
longer be needed now that async/await are available.  <code>AioCb</code>s now work
exclusively with borrowed buffers, not owned ones.

I might appear to have placed the helper functions in odd places, but it is to make the diff as easy to review as possible. We can always move them around once the initial code review is done, in case you find the current placement of them unacceptable. FWIW, I personally can live with their current placement.

This takes us one step closer to making SyntaxSet lazy-loaded, which in turn
takes us one step closer to solving #951. This change has proven useful in the prototype I made to improve startup time, see https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/issues/951#issuecomment-882098532

By my estimation, it will always be convenient to have the full SyntaxSet available, for things such as `--list-languages`. So regardless of the fate of the prototype in #951, I think this will end up being a sensible change.

1754,Make loading of cached assets closer in performance to integrated assets,"When [measuring performance](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/pull/1747#issuecomment-886392521) of lazy loading, I noticed a somewhat surprising discrepancy for loop-through performance with and without cached assets. So I looked into possible causes for that and noticed we can make loading of cached assets faster. (Remember: we still eagerly load themes.bin in the above lazy-load PR.)

Using `BufReader` makes sense for large files, but I am convinced assets are never large enough (until proven otherwise) to require buffering. It is significantly faster to load the file contents in one go, so let's do that instead.

The numbers are identical when loading integrated assets. Here are the performance measurements when loading assets that are identical to the integrated assets. I am comparing git master with the code in this PR:
```
% mkdir -p ~/.cache/bat
% echo ""---\nbat_version: 0.18.2"" > ~/.cache/bat/metadata.yaml
% cp assets/syntaxes.bin ~/.cache/bat/syntaxes.bin
% cp assets/themes.bin ~/.cache/bat/themes.bin
% hyperfine --export-markdown /dev/tty -L bat bat,bat-pr '{bat} --color always examples/simple.rs'

1747,Reduce startup time in loop-through mode by 80%-90%,"`HighlightingAssets::get_syntax_set()` is never called when e.g. piping the `bat` output to a file (see `Config::loop_through`), so by loading the `SyntaxSet` only when needed, we radically improve startup time when it is not needed.

On my low-end machine, I get the following numbers when doing
`time bat tests/examples/multiline.txt > /tmp/output.txt`:

**git master**
```
0,09s user 0,00s system 93% cpu 0,103 total
```

**git master + this PR**
```
0,01s user 0,00s system 63% cpu 0,026 total
```

We can also benchmark with `hyperfine` , in which case we don't need to redirect the output manually, because the internal redirection of `hyperfine` is enough to trigger loop-through mode:
`hyperfine --export-markdown /dev/tty 'bat tests/examples/multiline.txt'`

**git master**
| Command | Mean [ms] | Min [ms] | Max [ms] | Relative |
|:---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `bat tests/examples/multiline.txt` | 96.1 ± 2.2 | 93.3 | 104.3 | 1.00 |

**git master + this PR**
| Command | Mean [ms] | Min [ms] | Max [ms] | Relative |
|:---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `bat tests/examples/multiline.txt` | 11.2 ± 1.1 | 9.7 | 15.9 | 1.00 |

So on my system, the speedup amounts to (1-11.2/96.1)*100 ~ 88%.

Lazy-loading was one of the key aspects of my [prototype](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/issues/951#issuecomment-882098532) on how to improve the startup speed of bat, and this PR is one step on the journey to improve startup speed in general.

I have done sanity checking of this change, and all regression tests pass, so this PR should not be far off production-quality code. But don't hesitate to give criticism when doing code review :) And if you think my approach is completely off track, I would gladly like to know!

I also want to clarify that I think this is a good move long term, even if we start to load partial syntax sets for improved  performance.

But I would be surprised if it would not come in handy for other uses as well in the future.

I choose to name the arg `--no-custom-assets` rather than `--no-cache` in order to be more future-proof with upcoming changes. Since it is a hidden arg, I figured it would be OK to do it like this. I do not mention it in CHANGELOG.md though, since I don't think we need to make it publicly visible at this point.

1762,Add code for analyzing dependencies between syntaxes,"This will eventually allow us to improve the startup speed of bat. See #951.

It adds code to analyze dependencies between `SyntaxDefinition`s. It currently comes up with the following  list of independent syntaxes.

One thing I'm curious about is if you think this list, and the code I use to produce it, looks reasonable? Or can you spot any obvious dependencies that it fails to find?

I'm sure we're going to have to tweak the code that does the analysis, but it would be nice to get the basics of it in place so we can iterate on it.

<p><em>Sourced from <a href=""https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md"">nix's changelog</a>.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<h2>[0.22.0] - 9 July 2021</h2>
<h3>Added</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added <code>if_nameindex</code> (#<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1445"">1445</a>)</li>
<li>Added <code>nmount</code> for FreeBSD.
(#<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1453"">1453</a>)</li>
<li>Added <code>IpFreebind</code> socket option (sockopt) on Linux, Fuchsia and Android.
(#<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1456"">1456</a>)</li>
<li>Added <code>TcpUserTimeout</code> socket option (sockopt) on Linux and Fuchsia.
(#<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1457"">1457</a>)</li>
<li>Added <code>renameat2</code> for Linux
(#<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1458"">1458</a>)</li>
<li>Added <code>RxqOvfl</code> support on Linux, Fuchsia and Android.
(#<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1455"">1455</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Changed</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>ptsname_r</code> now returns a lossily-converted string in the event of bad UTF,
just like <code>ptsname</code>.
(<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1446"">#1446</a>)</li>
<li>Nix's error type is now a simple wrapper around the platform's Errno.  This
means it is now <code>Into&lt;std::io::Error&gt;</code>.  It's also <code>Clone</code>, <code>Copy</code>, <code>Eq</code>, and
has a small fixed size.  It also requires less typing.  For example, the old
enum variant <code>nix::Error::Sys(nix::errno::Errno::EINVAL)</code> is now simply
<code>nix::Error::EINVAL</code>.
(<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1446"">#1446</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fixed</h3>
<h3>Removed</h3>

1776,"When returning a SyntaxReference, also return the SyntaxSet that contains it","Here comes what I think will be the most controversial change on the #951 journey, because it has the highest impact on the bat-as-a-library API. Let me know what you think about it.

To improve startup performance, we will later load smaller `SyntaxSet`s instead of one giant one. However, the current API assumes only one `SyntaxSet` is ever used, and that that implicitly is the `SyntaxSet` from which returned `SyntaxReference`s comes.

This change changes the API to reflect that `SyntaxSet` and `SyntaxReference` are tightly coupled, and enables the use of several `SyntaxSet`.

I think it will make sense to add a helper method to reduce the boilerplate a bit, but I would like to get early feedback on the change itself before I do that.

### How to generate code coverage for bat

For future reference (not least for myself :P), here are some commands that can be used to generate code coverage data for `bat` **and** its dependencies:

```
# Installation and setup
rustup default nightly
rustup update nightly
cargo install cargo-binutils
rustup component add llvm-tools-preview
export LLVM_PROFILE_FILE=""/tmp/coverage/%h-%p-%m.profraw""

# Generate fresh, raw and broad code coverage data
rm -rf /tmp/coverage
cargo clean
RUSTFLAGS=""-Z instrument-coverage"" cargo test
# No cargo tests currently runs below commands, so manually create coverage for those code paths
./target/debug/bat cache --build --source=assets --blank --target=/tmp
./target/debug/bat cache --clear
./target/debug/bat -f --list-languages | tee
./target/debug/bat -f --list-themes | tee
cargo profdata -- merge -sparse -o /tmp/coverage/merged.profdata /tmp/coverage/*.profraw

# Exampeles of ways to study the code coverage data:
cargo cov -- report --use-color --instr-profile=/tmp/coverage/merged.profdata  --object target/debug/bat --object target/debug/deps/bat-c6a73c106dd2fad2 --object target/debug/deps/bat-475928d69fae452c --object target/debug/deps/assets-92dfcf99ce879949 --object target/debug/deps/integration_tests-182ccff1ff2b0a99 --object target/debug/deps/no_duplicate_extensions-88b0929ce16cf779 --object target/debug/deps/snapshot_tests-045e205813298711 --object target/debug/deps/tester-19f8f381c2571ded

```

Note that above code coverage is with the new more capable `-Z instrument-coverage` flag, and not the old `-Zprofile` flag that we used to use in CI (see 557a748ac76)",48,2525,2021-08-07 10:20:41+00:00,2021-08-07 18:07:46+00:00,2021-08-07 21:31:48+00:00,2021-08-07 18:07:46+00:00,closed,True,0,1,10,0,1,10,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,sharkdp/bat
1786,Cargo.toml: Introduce 'quick-build-application' feature,"I frequently find myself having to rebuild the whole project (.e.g when switching between MSRV, stable, nightly). Because of that, it is useful if a rebuild goes fast. Two features in particular contribute significantly to build time, and those are `git` and `bugreport` (with `git_hash`).

This PR introduces a feature called `quick-build-application` that allows the app to be built without the above features. On my system, that results in ~25% faster builds:
```
hyperfine --max-runs 2 --time-unit second --export-markdown /dev/tty --parameter-list feature quick-build-application,full-application --prepare 'cargo clean' 'cargo build --no-default-features --features {feature}'
```

1787,Load independent and minimal syntax sets when using --language,"Ok, so now the #951 work is starting to get interesting.

This PR improves startup time in the following scenario:
* `--language` is used
* A syntax without any external dependencies is used (see complete list below)

To keep small and digestible PRs, that is the only scenario that this PR improves startup time for. The plan is to improve startup time for all code paths in the upcoming PR.

The binary size only increases by ~400 kB as a result of this PR. That is because each `SyntaxSet` contains only one `SyntaxDefinition`, so it is not possible to optimize further (with current `syntect` data structures).

But it also opens up a major long-term possibility:
* If we end up creating a separate `bat-assets` binary to build assets, we can still allow users to optionally keep the current capability in the main app

For the curious, here are some numbers, comparing `minimal-application` with `application` for stripped release builds. Note that I am including https://github.com/trishume/syntect/pull/345 in below numbers:

1802,Don't take a HighlightingAssets detour to build assets,"In the current code base, it is necessary to create a temporary `HighlightingAssets` instance to be able to build assets.

This PR moves the code to build assets to its own place, independent of `HighlightingAssets`. This allows us to significantly simplify `HighlightingAssets` since we can make `SerializedSyntaxSet` mandatory.

This also makes sense on a conceptual level. When building assets, it will never be necessary to also highlight source code. So it makes sense to stop using `HighlightingAssets` for this.

This means that we no longer allow clients of our API to build assets during startup. But that is very slow, and I can't imagine why anyone would want to do that. And this simplification is worth a lot in terms of flexibility. So IMHO it is worth having to deprecate API.

### New public API

I currently put the new API at
* `bat::assets::build`

to not introduce a new module. Another option I was considering was `bat::build_assets`. I am open to further ideas.

### Deprecated and no longer functional API

* `bat::assets::HighlightingAssets::from_files`
* `bat::assets::HighlightingAssets::save_to_cache`

### Background information

As I was experimenting with zero-copy deserialization (see #1787) I bumped into the problem of having to use `HighlightingAssets` to build assets. To support zero-copy deserialization, it will be natural to serialize temporarily owned data. Having to take a `HighlightingAssets` detour really complicates things.

But IMO this PR has merits of its own, regardless of the work related to #1787.

### Status of PR

I'm happy with the code, and consider it ready for CR. But I have not yet done broad verification. I would prefer to get your thoughts on this before I put much time on verification.

1820,Replace deprecated 'error-chain' with 'thiserror',"We currently depend on [error-chain](https://docs.rs/error-chain/0.12.4/error_chain/). But `error-chain` has been deprecated:
* https://github.com/rust-lang-deprecated/error-chain
* https://github.com/rust-lang-deprecated/failure/issues/181

So I think getting rid of `error-chain` will not be controversial. Exactly HOW to get rid of `error-chain` might be a bit controversial though. To get the discussion started, I here have a proposal on how to do it, which uses [thiserror](https://docs.rs/thiserror/1.0.26/thiserror/).

I did consider using `anyhow`, but read somewhere that someone thought that libraries should not use any particular high-level error handling library, but instead let apps pick one, and I thought that made sense. `thiserror` is just a derive-macro so one does not have to implement `Error` traits manually.

I have not done broad verification yet, but all regression tests pass, and basic error reporting work as before. Examples:

```rust

1832,README.md: Don't recommend --locked with cargo install bat,"In our `README.md`, we currently say this:

--- START QUOTE ---

### From source

If you want to build `bat` from source, you need Rust 1.45 or higher. You can then use `cargo` to build everything:

```bash
cargo install --locked bat
```

--- END QUOTE ---

But passing `--locked` does not make sense when installing from a crate, since `Cargo.toml` and `Cargo.lock` can not be out of sync. (I remember being confused about `--locked` when I first started out with Rust, and I think the current advice risks confusing more than it helps.) So this PR removes `--locked` from all versions of `README.md`

To be extra sure, I have verified that `cargo install bat` is enough, by doing:

```
% docker run -it debian:stable
# apt update
# apt install build-essential curl
# curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh # with defaults
# source $HOME/.cargo/env
# cargo install bat
# bat ~/.cargo/registry/src/github.com-1ecc6299db9ec823/bat-0.18.3/examples/simple.rs # works!
```

1831,CICD: Put documentation testing in its own job,"The time varies quite a lot, but instead of 10 - 13 min, it will take 6 - 7 min. We achieve the speedup by doing the following:
* Stop buildling e.g. `git2` by using `--features minimal-application,build-assets`.
* Stop running `cargo test` in ""Syntaxes and themes regression tests"". We run tests several times in other jobs, and there is no need to run them again in ""Syntaxes and themes regression tests"".
* To be able to get rid of `cargo test` completely, we convert ""All themes are present"" from an `#[ignore]` cargo test to a script that we run in CI. (I think it is quite nice to not have any `#[ignore]`d tests left, even if its just semantics.)
* Move documentation testing in its own job, since it does not depend on things we do in the syntaxes and themes regression test. This speeds up the syntaxes and themes regression test by about another minute.

Bonus side effect: Instead of having three files in the repo named `assets.rs`, we now only have two :)

This is ready for detailed review, but as usual I'd like to do some final verification before merge.

(I use this hacky command to verify that the public API is not changed:

```
% rm -f /tmp/all-*.html && for commit in master introduce-internal-assets-submodules; do git ch $commit && cargo clean -p bat && cargo doc --no-deps --all-features && cp target/doc/bat/all.html /tmp/all-$commit.html; done && diff -u /tmp/all-*.html | diff-so-fancy

1852,Simplify HighlightingAssets::get_syntax() first_line logic,"The first commit makes the following work via first_line_match:

```
bat --map-syntax='*.invalid-syntax:InvalidSyntax' tests/examples/regression_tests/first_line_fallback.invalid-syntax
```
and adds a regression test for it.

The second commit simplifies the code, thanks to the fix in the first commit. It is funny how adding features can result in simpler code.

All regression tests pass, but we don't seem to have that many regression tests for `--map-syntax`, so I might add some more after code review of this.

(The reason I am bothering to simplify the code at all is of course to make #951 easier to implement.)",58,631,2021-09-14 15:15:23+00:00,2021-09-16 15:01:12+00:00,2021-09-16 15:01:17+00:00,2021-09-16 15:01:12+00:00,closed,True,7,5,31,8,3,31,8,1,0,2,2,3,2,2,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,sharkdp/bat

Here is a map of current syntax dependencies (click to enlarge):

1858,Track dependents for each syntax,"Progress on #951 continues, and I now have work-in-progress code where `syntaxes.bin` has been removed, and every syntax is present in `minimal_syntaxes.bin`. Notably, without duplicates, so the size of `minimal_syntaxes.bin` is the same as `syntaxes.bin`, differing only by some tens of kbs.  See https://github.com/Enselic/bat/pull/38.

While there still are problems to solve, I am confident in some parts of the code, and will ~~start~~ continue to create separate PRs to take the code base in that direction. (Actually, #1856 is also this kind of PR.)

This PR consists of three commits. The first commit just renames stuff in preparation for the third commit. The second commits just moves code around a bit to fit better with the third commit. The ""real"" code is in the third commit. It adds code to add information about what dependents a syntax has. For example, the **Rust** syntax is a dependent for the **Markdown** syntax, because **Markdown** depends on **Rust** via `embed: scope:source.rust`.

Knowing the dependents of a syntax is useful when constructing `SyntaxSet`s without duplicate `SyntaxReference`s (and is used in https://github.com/Enselic/bat/pull/38).

While this code adds info about syntax dependents, there is a temporary env var flag that makes it not used yet when building assets. The env var will be removed later, and the dependents info will start being used when building assets.

1862,HighlightingAssets: Extract new public API method get_syntax_for_path(),"We do this mainly to reduce duplication of logic. The move to adjust the public API is more of a side effect. It so happens that adjusting the public API also simplifies the code.

One of the reasons this refactoring works is that the `.file_name()` of a `file_name` is `file_name` unchanged:
```
    #[test]
    fn file_name_of_file_name_is_same() {
        let path = Path::new(""test.rs"");

If `cargo smart-release` is used for release, a `cargo release` compatible tag will be generated which carries the relevant section from the changelog, as well as a GitHub release, if the `gh` executable is found. Note that it generates special versions for each target to get the best possible rendering.

Since we don't want bat to crash, I think we should make sure to not ship any additional incomplete syntaxes. Here is a Draft PR on how we could ensure that.

We might want to make it opt-in (for CI) or opt-out (for users building custom assets), but before we tweak that I would like to hear what you think about the general idea.

I actually don't think it is a viable option to make syntect handle incomplete syntaxes. Even if syntect ignores missing syntaxes, what should it do instead? It seems to me as if the risk is high for follow-up problems if syntect tries to ignores problems like these.

1918,Add APIs to get paths for config and cache directories,"Fixes #1917

This PR moves `src/bin/bat/directories.rs` to `src/assets/directories.rs` and publish `BatProjectDirs` as an API so that `bat` crate library users can get bat's config and cache directories from their Rust programs.",54,230,2021-10-23 12:21:31+00:00,,2021-10-23 13:46:44+00:00,2021-10-23 13:46:44+00:00,closed,False,1,2,14,17,6,14,17,0,0,6,6,3,2,2,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,sharkdp/bat
1920,Add `bat::PrettyPrinter::clear_highlights`,"Fixes #1919

With this API, the code written in #1919 can be improved as follows:

```rust
use bat::PrettyPrinter;

let targets: (PathBuf, Vec<(usize, usize)>) = vec![];

let mut pp = PrettyPrinter::new();
for (path, ranges) in targets.iter() {
    pp.input_file(path);
    for (start, end) in ranges.iter() {
        pp.highlight_range(*start, *end);
    }

    pp.print().unwrap();
    // Clear highlights for next iteration
    pp.clear_highlights();
}

1923,Update alternatives.md,I have been using the bat for a while now saw that it's also registered for the Hacktober competition but due to my lack of knowledge I could only contribute a change to this document. :) Thanks for making this awesome tool,22,223,2021-10-27 12:16:48+00:00,,2021-11-09 18:35:10+00:00,2021-11-09 18:35:10+00:00,closed,False,1,1,2,7,1,2,7,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,sharkdp/bat
1921,Include git hash in `bat -V` and `bat --version` output if present,"I had to use a `lazy_static` due to the strange clap API that only accepts a reference to a version string. And, in our current code, only a 'static reference to a version string is accepted. Code could of course be refactored, but it would be way more messy.

I have several binaries of `bat` lying around everywhere, and with this PR, I (and anyone else of course) can just do `bat -V` to find out exactly what version of bat is at hand. Right now I have to do `bat --diagnostics | head`, which is too unergonomic for my taste.

I could of course have a local script to avoid repetition, but who wants to local scripts for these kinds of things?

The output looks like this:
```
% cargo run -- -V
bat 0.18.3 (9291a79)

% cargo run -- --version
bat 0.18.3 (9291a79)
```

which is identical to the output format in `--diagnostic`:

```
% cargo run -- --diagnostic | head -n 3
#### Software version

bat 0.18.3 (9291a79)
```

If no git repo is available at build time, the output is the same as before:

```
% touch src/bin/bat/main.rs # force rebuild

% GIT_DIR=/not-present cargo run -- -V
bat 0.18.3

% GIT_DIR=/not-present cargo run -- --version
bat 0.18.3

1938,Strip BOM from output in interactive mode,"Fixes #1922 

This is my first contribution to an open source project so I apologize in advance for any misunderstandings!

I tried finding somewhere where the output is known to be shown in an interactive mode, and `InteractivePrinter` looked right on. Removed the BOM if present on the first line. Also made sure the BOM is not stripped if output is piped to a file/other program.

Contents of first line copied from `bat Program.cs.txt` (see #1922 for example file):

![Screenshot from 2021-11-08 09-54-57](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16627772/140713083-231885e2-afd0-448f-b897-24f58d3f3b74.png)

Contents of file obtained from `bat Program.cs.txt > test.txt`:

![Screenshot from 2021-11-08 09-58-06](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16627772/140713095-4db7fd53-2033-4c10-88f4-c0bb27a3499b.png)

The `utf16` test then fails since it expects the output to contain the BOM. As far as I can tell the test runs `bat` in interactive mode, so I assumed this to be incorrect now. I changed the expected test output to not contain the BOM anymore. 

I have probably missed some important things to consider, and there are probably better ways to do this than `std::str::replace`.",41,1213,2021-11-08 09:05:49+00:00,2022-09-06 17:08:38+00:00,2022-09-06 17:08:38+00:00,2022-09-06 17:08:38+00:00,closed,True,15,9,67,4,5,67,4,1,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,sharkdp/bat

1945,Blend alpha value of gutter foreground color,"Currently bat ignores an alpha value of gutter foreground color. This breaks gutter colors of some color themes. Here is the example with `Nord` theme:

- Current master branch

<img width=""521"" alt=""before"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/823277/141673768-898786ea-f68d-4b55-a693-a0110e4a3eaa.png"">

As you see, gutter color of `Nord` theme is very light on current master branch. This is because the gutter color has actually an alpha value smaller than 255, which makes the color darker.

With this PR, the alpha value is correctly considered by blending the foreground color and the background color on initializing a printer instance.

1951,Remove minimal syntaxes,"Now that [my syntect PR to lazy-load syntaxes](https://github.com/trishume/syntect/pull/393) has landed in syntect git master (:tada:), we can start to prepare for that in bat.

The first step is to remove all **minimal_syntaxes.bin** related code. It's not needed any longer since lazy-loading of syntaxes in syntect works much better.

| Command | Mean [ms] | Min [ms] | Max [ms] | Relative |
|:---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `bat-v0.18.3 --color=always --language Rust examples/simple.rs` | 106.1 ± 2.0 | 103.5 | 113.1 | 4.58 ± 0.23 |
| `bat-lazy --color=always --language Rust examples/simple.rs` | 25.6 ± 1.0 | 23.9 | 29.2 | 1.10 ± 0.07 |
| `bat-minimal-syntaxes --color=always --language Rust examples/simple.rs` | 23.1 ± 1.1 | 21.4 | 27.7 | 1.00 |

* **bat-lazy** is this PR + syntect git master (https://github.com/Enselic/bat/pull/62)
* **bat-minimal-syntaxes** is current bat git master that uses minimal_syntaxes.bin.

As we can see, syntect lazy-loading is almost as fast. And I'm pretty confident in that if we were to take `minimal_syntaxes.bin ""all the way"", it would also add the extra milliseconds that the syntax lazy-loading has, if not more.

Much more importantly, lazy-loading syntect is faster in *all* cases, not just for half of our syntaxes when using `--language`. There are a lot more to say and do about syntect lazy-loading. More PRs and benchmarks will come in the near future :)

A bit sad to see the nifty graphviz analyzis code go of course, but it's not needed any longer. And it will always be available in git log. And in our hearts :)",23,1585,2021-11-22 17:04:35+00:00,2021-11-22 19:42:01+00:00,2021-11-30 19:43:31+00:00,2021-11-22 19:42:01+00:00,closed,True,0,2,5,511,7,5,511,0,3,4,4,5,3,3,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,sharkdp/bat
1952,Replace `lazycell` and `lazy_static` with `once_cell`,"We originally started to use lazycell because syntect was already using lazycell.

Syntect recently started to use once_cell instead to fix a race condition, see https://github.com/trishume/syntect/pull/391.

Once we start using the upcoming version of syntect, we will also want to stop using lazycell. So we might as well stop doing that already now.

once_cell is maintained by matklad (https://github.com/matklad/once_cell) and there is an open RFC to add its API to the standard library: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2788. So starting to use once_cell should be a safe move.

Another nice thing with once_cell is that it supports lazy_static use cases without any macro magic (see https://docs.rs/once_cell/1.8.0/once_cell/#lazy-initialized-global-data). So this PR also removes our use of lazy_static and replaces it with once_cell.

1953,Improved benchmark suite,"In the spirit of #1751, this PR adds the possibility of creating a Markdown report from our ""benchmark suite"" (see exemplary output at the end of this post). It also cleans up the benchmark script and adds a couple of (hopefully) useful benchmarks. In particular, it adds a benchmark that should be able to demonstrate the effect of #1596.

I hope that this script can be used as a basis for future benchmarking work. It should be straightforward to extend it with more benchmarks.

* 47149fc Move comparison.sh benchmark script to documentation
* b6ca894 Simplify cargo-target-dir extraction
* ef5afa5 Markdown (and JSON) reports
* c10ecc2 Clean benchmarking environment
* 8d42d9f Remove jquery-3.3.1.min.js benchmark
* 68afb5c Rename jquery file
* 2514066 Add Python highlighting test
* 4da7fbf Add test for ANSI sequence loop-through

1957,run-benchmarks.sh: Add third 'Startup time' variant,"Using Markdown for a startup test is useful since it has so many dependencies on
other syntaxes. So such a test makes sure that lazy-loading of syntaxes work.

It is however also useful to measure the startup time of bat when the time to
load a syntax is very small, and the measured startup time has mostly non-syntax
related causes. Such as:
 * Parsing arguments
 * Setting up syntax mappings
 * Loading themes

This commit adds such a test. It uses the CpuInfo syntax which is very small.
Only 14 lines, compared to the 1581 lines that Markdown is (not including the
size of its included syntaxes).

This command can be used to get an approximation of the size of syntaxes, and
thus how expensive they are to lazy-load:

    find -name *.sublime-syntax -print0 | xargs --null wc -l | sort -n -r

Example output from `run-benchmarks.sh`:

1959,Better syntax highlighting for Dart,"Closes  #1958

This PR changes the dart highlighting source package to  [elMuso/Dartlight](https://github.com/elMuso/Dartlight).

This fixes the bug mentioned in the issue. I added a syntax test to check that comments in function calls are highlighted correctly.

However, the highlighting changes quite a bit. The two screenshots below show the difference :

1969,Lazy load themes,"To further improve upon #951: It is quite easy to start lazy-loading themes, and it can be done without any changes to syntect.

It makes `bat` start ~25% faster when syntaxes are also lazy loaded. 

This might feel like overkill, but it is necessary if we want to be able to add new themes without feeling guilty about impacting startup time negatively.

Performance is not affected by this change. Here is git master vs this PR:

1971,Give credit to syntax definition and theme authors with new `--acknowledgements` option,"The text that is printed is generated when building assets, by analyzing LICENSE and NOTICE files that comes with syntaxes and themes. If an unknown license is encountered, an error is raised, which will e.g. cause CI to fail.

Currently the `acknowledgements.bin` file is generated when passing `--blank` to `bat cache --build`, which we notably do in our `create.sh` script. So it should not affect regular users. We might want to also require `--acknowledgements` to be passed, like this: `bat cache --build --blank --acknowledgements ...` to really rule out accidental invocation. (Edit: After thinking about it some more I pushed a commit for that.) There is no point in messing around with acknowledgements when users build custom assets. In fact, the output of `--acknowledgements` should be the same, regardless of if custom assets are used or not.

I have not done super thorough verification of this PR, but I consider it sophisticated enough to warrant opening a PR for it and discuss high level aspects of it.

It is possible to imagine bells and whistles on this, like smarter text wrapping of the output, or automatic invocation of the pager, but I would prefer to not do that in this MVP PR.

      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the

      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable

      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,

      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)

      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the

          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a ""NOTICE"" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an ""AS IS"" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an ""AS IS"" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      ""License"" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      ""Licensor"" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      ""Legal Entity"" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      ""control"" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      ""You"" (or ""Your"") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      ""Source"" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      ""Object"" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      ""Work"" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      ""Derivative Works"" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      ""Contribution"" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, ""submitted""
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as ""Not a Contribution.""

      ""Contributor"" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a ""NOTICE"" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an ""AS IS"" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      ""Legal Entity"" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,

      ""You"" (or ""Your"") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      ""Source"" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      ""Object"" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      ""Work"" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      ""Derivative Works"" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      ""Contribution"" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, ""submitted""
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as ""Not a Contribution.""

      ""Contributor"" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a ""NOTICE"" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an ""AS IS"" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

I have attempted to fix this in two ways: the [first commit](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/pull/1985/commits/129210e9fa181c06409d5ad085a0b0744cc5fb1d) is a simple, ANSI-specific condition.
The [second commit](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/pull/1985/commits/31404f6a172c74936481189fec58e0ec05975efd) is using a custom scope to allow each theme to customise how the highlighted line's font style is set.

Let me know what you think and I can squash to a single final commit.

1981,assets/create.sh: Reverse patches even if `bat cache` fails or aborts,"I quite frequently encounter this inconvenience:

**Step-by-step:**
1. Make some changes to how assets are built
2. Rebuild assets with `cargo build && PATH=""./target/debug:$PATH"" assets/create.sh`
3. While assets are built, realize I made a mistake and abort with Ctrl+C

**Expected result:**
Patches are not applied any longer since `create.sh` was aborted

**Actual result:**
Patches are still applied, causing an error when `create.sh` is invoked next time. I usually run `git submodule update --init --force` to get rid of the patches. But then there are always some `.rej` files lying around I have to clean up manually...

This PR reverses the patches in a trap, so that patches are reversed even if `bat cache` is aborted with Ctrl + C (or fails for other reasons)

2006,Bump clap from 2.34.0 to 3.0.0,"Bumps [clap](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap) from 2.34.0 to 3.0.0.
<details>
<summary>Changelog</summary>
<p><em>Sourced from <a href=""https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md"">clap's changelog</a>.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<h2>[3.0.0] - 2021-12-31</h2>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> clap v3 has been in development for several years and has changed
hands multiple times.  Unfortunately, our changelog might be incomplete,
whether in changes or their motivation.</p>
<h3>Highlights</h3>
<p>A special thanks to the maintainers, contributors, beta users, and sponsors who
have helped along this journey, especially kbknapp.</p>
<p><strong><a href=""https://docs.rs/structopt/"">StructOpt</a> Integration</strong></p>
<p><a href=""https://docs.rs/structopt/"">StructOpt</a> provides a serde-like declarative
approach to defining your parser.  The main benefits we've seen so far from integrating are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tighter feedback between the design of clap and the derives</li>
<li>More universal traits.  Crates exist for common CLI patterns
(<a href=""https://github.com/rust-cli/clap-verbosity-flag"">example</a>)
and we've re-designed the <code>StructOpt</code> traits so crates built on clap3 can be
reused not just with other derives but also people using the builder API.
People can even hand implement these so people using the builder API won't
have the pay the cost for derives.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Custom Help Headings</strong></p>
<p>Previously, clap automatically grouped arguments in the help as either
<code>ARGS</code>, <code>FLAGS</code>, <code>OPTIONS</code>, and <code>SUBCOMMANDS</code>.</p>
<p>You can now override the default group with <code>Arg::help_heading</code> and
<code>App::subcommand_help_heading</code>.  To apply a heading to a series of arguments,
you can set <code>App::help_heading</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Deprecations</strong></p>
<p>While a lot of deprecations have been added to clean up the API (overloaded
meaning of <code>Arg::multiple</code>) or make things more consistent, some particular
highlights are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>clap_app!</code> has been deprecated in favor of the builder API with <code>arg!</code> (<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/clap-rs/clap/issues/2835"">clap-rs/clap#2835</a>)</li>
<li><code>Arg::from_usage</code> has been deprecated in favor of <code>arg!</code> (<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/clap-rs/clap/issues/3087"">clap-rs/clap#3087</a>)
<ul>
<li><a href=""https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/commit/4c4a2b86a08ef9e2d63010aab4909dd5a013dfb0"">Porting example</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The YAML API has been deprecated in favor the builder or derive APIs (<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/clap-rs/clap/issues/3087"">clap-rs/clap#3087</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Migrating</h3>
<p><strong>From clap v2</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Add CLI tests, <code>-h</code> and <code>--help</code> output at a minimum (recommendation: <a href=""https://docs.rs/trycmd/"">trycmd</a> for snapshot testing)</li>
<li>Update your dependency
<ol>
<li><em>If you use <code>no-default-features</code>:</em> add the <code>std</code> feature</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Resolve compiler errors</li>
</ol>

## Dependencies

See this page for a good overview: https://deps.rs/repo/github/sharkdp/bat

- [x] Optional: update dependencies with `cargo update`. This is also done by
      dependabot, so it is not strictly necessary.
- [x] Install [cargo-outdated](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-outdated). Check
      for outdated dependencies with `cargo outdated --root-deps-only` and
      decide for each of them whether we want to (manually) upgrade. This will
      require changes to `Cargo.toml`.
```
% cargo outdated --root-deps-only 
Name  Project  Compat  Latest  Kind    Platform
----  -------  ------  ------  ----    --------
clap  2.34.0   ---     3.0.5   Normal  ---
```

## Version bump

- [x] Update version in `Cargo.toml`. Run `cargo build` to update `Cargo.lock`.
      Make sure to `git add` the `Cargo.lock` changes as well.
- [x] Find the current min. supported Rust version by running
      `grep '^\s*MIN_SUPPORTED_RUST_VERSION' .github/workflows/CICD.yml`.
- [x] Update the version and the min. supported Rust version in `README.md` and
      `doc/README-*.md`. Check with `git grep -i 'rust.*1\.'` and
      `git grep -i '1\..*rust'`.
- [x] Update `CHANGELOG.md`. Introduce a section for the new release.


## Update syntaxes and themes (build assets)

- [x] Install the latest master version (`cargo install -f --path .`) and make
      sure that it is available on the `PATH` (`bat --version` should show the
      new version).
```
% bat --version
bat 0.19.0 (c378c73)
```
- [x] Run `assets/create.sh` and check in the binary asset files.

## Documentation

- [x] Review the `-h` and `--help` texts
```

bat 0.19.0 (c378c73)
A cat(1) clone with syntax highlighting and Git integration.

USAGE:
    bat [OPTIONS] [FILE]...
    bat <SUBCOMMAND>

OPTIONS:
    -A, --show-all
            Show non-printable characters like space, tab or newline. This option can also be used
            to print binary files. Use '--tabs' to control the width of the tab-placeholders.
    -p, --plain                                 
            Only show plain style, no decorations. This is an alias for '--style=plain'. When '-p'
            is used twice ('-pp'), it also disables automatic paging (alias for '--style=plain
            --pager=never').
    -l, --language <language>                   
            Explicitly set the language for syntax highlighting. The language can be specified as a
            name (like 'C++' or 'LaTeX') or possible file extension (like 'cpp', 'hpp' or 'md'). Use
            '--list-languages' to show all supported language names and file extensions.
    -H, --highlight-line <N:M>...               
            Highlight the specified line ranges with a different background color For example:
              '--highlight-line 40' highlights line 40
              '--highlight-line 30:40' highlights lines 30 to 40
              '--highlight-line :40' highlights lines 1 to 40
              '--highlight-line 40:' highlights lines 40 to the end of the file
              '--highlight-line 30:+10' highlights lines 30 to 40
        --file-name <name>...                   
            Specify the name to display for a file. Useful when piping data to bat from STDIN when
            bat does not otherwise know the filename. Note that the provided file name is also used
            for syntax detection.
    -d, --diff
            Only show lines that have been added/removed/modified with respect to the Git index. Use
            --diff-context=N to control how much context you want to see.
        --diff-context <N>                      
            Include N lines of context around added/removed/modified lines when using '--diff'.

            Set the tab width to T spaces. Use a width of 0 to pass tabs through directly

        --wrap <mode>
            Specify the text-wrapping mode (*auto*, never, character). The '--terminal-width' option
            can be used in addition to control the output width.
        --terminal-width <width>
            Explicitly set the width of the terminal instead of determining it automatically. If
            prefixed with '+' or '-', the value will be treated as an offset to the actual terminal
            width. See also: '--wrap'.
    -n, --number                                
            Only show line numbers, no other decorations. This is an alias for '--style=numbers'

        --color <when>                          
            Specify when to use colored output. The automatic mode only enables colors if an
            interactive terminal is detected - colors are automatically disabled if the output goes
            to a pipe.
            Possible values: *auto*, never, always.
        --italic-text <when>                    
            Specify when to use ANSI sequences for italic text in the output. Possible values:
            always, *never*.
        --decorations <when>
            Specify when to use the decorations that have been specified via '--style'. The
            automatic mode only enables decorations if an interactive terminal is detected. Possible
            values: *auto*, never, always.
    -f, --force-colorization                    
            Alias for '--decorations=always --color=always'. This is useful if the output of bat is
            piped to another program, but you want to keep the colorization/decorations.
        --paging <when>
            Specify when to use the pager. To disable the pager, use --paging=never' or its
            alias,'-P'. To disable the pager permanently, set BAT_PAGER to an empty string. To
            control which pager is used, see the '--pager' option. Possible values: *auto*, never,
            always.
        --pager <command>                       
            Determine which pager is used. This option will override the PAGER and BAT_PAGER
            environment variables. The default pager is 'less'. To control when the pager is used,
            see the '--paging' option. Example: '--pager ""less -RF""'.
    -m, --map-syntax <glob:syntax>...
            Map a glob pattern to an existing syntax name. The glob pattern is matched on the full
            path and the filename. For example, to highlight *.build files with the Python syntax,
            use -m '*.build:Python'. To highlight files named '.myignore' with the Git Ignore
            syntax, use -m '.myignore:Git Ignore'. Note that the right-hand side is the *name* of
            the syntax, not a file extension.
        --ignored-suffix <ignored-suffix>...
            Ignore extension. For example:
              'bat --ignored-suffix "".dev"" my_file.json.dev' will use JSON syntax, and ignore '.dev'
        --theme <theme>                         
            Set the theme for syntax highlighting. Use '--list-themes' to see all available themes.
            To set a default theme, add the '--theme=""...""' option to the configuration file or
            export the BAT_THEME environment variable (e.g.: export BAT_THEME=""..."").
        --list-themes                           
            Display a list of supported themes for syntax highlighting.

        --style <components>
            Configure which elements (line numbers, file headers, grid borders, Git modifications,
            ..) to display in addition to the file contents. The argument is a comma-separated list
            of components to display (e.g. 'numbers,changes,grid') or a pre-defined style ('full').
            To set a default style, add the '--style=""..""' option to the configuration file or
            export the BAT_STYLE environment variable (e.g.: export BAT_STYLE="".."").
            
            Possible values:
            
              * full: enables all available components (default).
              * auto: same as 'full', unless the output is piped.
              * plain: disables all available components.
              * changes: show Git modification markers.
              * header: show filenames before the content.
              * grid: vertical/horizontal lines to separate side bar
                      and the header from the content.
              * rule: horizontal lines to delimit files.
              * numbers: show line numbers in the side bar.
              * snip: draw separation lines between distinct line ranges.
    -r, --line-range <N:M>...                   
            Only print the specified range of lines for each file. For example:
              '--line-range 30:40' prints lines 30 to 40
              '--line-range :40' prints lines 1 to 40
              '--line-range 40:' prints lines 40 to the end of the file
              '--line-range 40' only prints line 40
              '--line-range 30:+10' prints lines 30 to 40
    -L, --list-languages                        
            Display a list of supported languages for syntax highlighting.

    -u, --unbuffered                            
            This option exists for POSIX-compliance reasons ('u' is for 'unbuffered'). The output is
            always unbuffered - this option is simply ignored.
        --diagnostic                            
            Show diagnostic information for bug reports.

        --acknowledgements                      
            Show acknowledgements.

    -h, --help                                  
            Print this help message.

    -V, --version                               
            Show version information.

NAME
       bat - a cat(1) clone with syntax highlighting and Git integration.

USAGE
       bat [OPTIONS] [FILE]...

       bat cache [CACHE-OPTIONS] [--build|--clear]

DESCRIPTION
       bat  prints  the syntax-highlighted content of a collection of FILEs to
       the terminal. If no FILE is specified, or when FILE is  '-',  it  reads
       from standard input.

       bat  supports  a  large number of programming and markup languages.  It
       also communicates with git(1) to show modifications with respect to the
       git  index.   bat  automatically  pipes  its output through a pager (by
       default: less).

       Whenever the output of bat goes to  a  non-interactive  terminal,  i.e.
       when  the output is piped into another process or into a file, bat will
       act as a drop-in replacement for cat(1) and fall back to  printing  the
       plain file contents.


OPTIONS
       General  remarks: Command-line options like '-l'/'--language' that take
       values  can  be  specified  as  either  '--language   value',   '--lan-
       guage=value', '-l value' or '-lvalue'.

       -A, --show-all

              Show  non-printable  characters  like space, tab or newline. Use
              '--tabs' to control the width of the tab-placeholders.

       -p, --plain

              Only show plain style, no decorations.  This  is  an  alias  for
              '--style=plain'.  When  '-p' is used twice ('-pp'), it also dis-
              ables    automatic    paging    (alias    for     '--style=plain
              --pager=never').

       -l, --language <language>

              Explicitly  set  the  language for syntax highlighting. The lan-
              guage can be specified as a name (like 'C++' or 'LaTeX') or pos-
              sible   file   extension   (like  'cpp',  'hpp'  or  'md').  Use
              '--list-languages' to show all supported language names and file
              extensions.

       -H, --highlight-line <N:M>...

              Highlight  the specified line ranges with a different background
              color. For example:

              --highlight-line 40
                     highlights line 40

              --highlight-line 30:40
                     highlights lines 30 to 40

              --highlight-line :40
                     highlights lines 1 to 40

              --highlight-line 40:
                     highlights lines 40 to the end of the file

              --highlight-line 30:+10
                     highlights lines 30 to 40

       --file-name <name>...

              Specify the name to display for a file. Useful when piping  data
              to bat from STDIN when bat does not otherwise know the filename.
              Note that the provided file name is also used for syntax  detec-
              tion.

       -d, --diff

              Only  show  lines  that  have  been  added/removed/modified with
              respect to the Git index. Use '--diff-context=N' to control  how
              much context you want to see.

       --diff-context <N>...

              Include  N  lines of context around added/removed/modified lines
              when using '--diff'.

       --tabs <T>

              Set the tab width to T spaces. Use a width of  0  to  pass  tabs
              through directly

       --wrap <mode>

              Specify  the  text-wrapping mode (*auto*, never, character). The
              '--terminal-width' option can be used in addition to control the
              output width.

       --terminal-width <width>

              Explicitly  set the width of the terminal instead of determining
              it automatically. If prefixed with '+' or '-', the value will be
              treated  as  an  offset  to the actual terminal width. See also:
              '--wrap'.

       -n, --number

              Only show line numbers, no other decorations. This is  an  alias
              for '--style=numbers'

       --color <when>

              Specify  when  to  use  colored  output. The automatic mode only
              enables colors if an interactive terminal is detected.  Possible
              values: *auto*, never, always.

       --italic-text <when>

              Specify  when  to use ANSI sequences for italic text in the out-
              put. Possible values: always, *never*.

       --decorations <when>

              Specify when to use the decorations that have been specified via
              '--style'.  The  automatic  mode  only enables decorations if an
              interactive  terminal  is  detected.  Possible  values:  *auto*,
              never, always.

       -f, --force-colorization

              Alias  for '--decorations=always --color=always'. This is useful
              if the output of bat is piped to another program, but  you  want
              to keep the colorization/decorations.

       --paging <when>

              Specify when to use the pager. To disable the pager, use '--pag-
              ing=never' or its alias, -P. To disable the  pager  permanently,
              set  BAT_PAGER  to  an  empty  string. To control which pager is
              used, see the '--pager' option. Possible values: *auto*,  never,
              always.

       --pager <command>

              Determine  which  pager  is  used. This option will override the
              PAGER and BAT_PAGER environment variables. The default pager  is
              'less'.  To  control  when the pager is used, see the '--paging'
              option. Example: '--pager ""less -RF""'.

              Note: By default, if the pager is set to 'less' (and no command-
              line  options are specified), 'bat' will pass the following com-
              mand line  options  to  the  pager:  '-R'/'--RAW-CONTROL-CHARS',
              '-F'/'--quit-if-one-screen'   and   '-X'/'--no-init'.  The  last
              option ('-X') is only used for 'less' versions older  than  530.
              The  '-R'  option  is needed to interpret ANSI colors correctly.
              The second option ('-F') instructs less to exit  immediately  if
              the  output size is smaller than the vertical size of the termi-
              nal. This is convenient for small files because you do not  have
              to  press  'q'  to  quit  the  pager. The third option ('-X') is
              needed to fix a bug with the '--quit-if-one-screen'  feature  in
              old  versions  of  'less'.  Unfortunately, it also breaks mouse-
              wheel support in 'less'.  If  you  want  to  enable  mouse-wheel
              scrolling  on  older  versions of 'less', you can pass just '-R'
              (as in the example above, this  will  disable  the  quit-if-one-
              screen  feature).  For  less 530 or newer, it should work out of
              the box.

       -m, --map-syntax <glob-pattern:syntax-name>...

              Map a glob pattern to an existing syntax name. The glob  pattern
              is  matched  on  the full path and the filename. For example, to
              highlight  *.build  files  with  the  Python  syntax,   use   -m
              '*.build:Python'.  To highlight files named '.myignore' with the
              Git Ignore syntax, use -m '.myignore:Git Ignore'.  Note that the
              right-hand  side  is the *name* of the syntax, not a file exten-
              sion.

       --theme <theme>

              Set the theme for syntax highlighting.  Use  '--list-themes'  to
              see  all  available  themes.   To  set  a default theme, add the
              '--theme=""...""' option to the configuration file or  export  the
              BAT_THEME environment variable (e.g.: export BAT_THEME=""..."").

       --list-themes

              Display a list of supported themes for syntax highlighting.

       --style <style-components>

              Configure  which elements (line numbers, file headers, grid bor-
              ders, Git modifications, ..) to display in addition to the  file
              contents.  The  argument is a comma-separated list of components
              to display (e.g. 'numbers,changes,grid') or a pre-defined  style
              ('full').  To set a default style, add the '--style=""..""' option
              to the configuration file or export  the  BAT_STYLE  environment
              variable (e.g.: export BAT_STYLE=""..""). Possible values: *full*,
              auto, plain, changes, header, grid, rule, numbers, snip.

       -r, --line-range <N:M>...

              Only print the specified range of lines for each file. For exam-
              ple:

              --line-range 30:40
                     prints lines 30 to 40

              --line-range :40
                     prints lines 1 to 40

              --line-range 40:
                     prints lines 40 to the end of the file

              --line-range 30:+10
                     prints lines 30 to 40

       -L, --list-languages

              Display a list of supported languages for syntax highlighting.

       -u, --unbuffered

              This  option  exists  for  POSIX-compliance  reasons ('u' is for
              'unbuffered'). The output is always unbuffered - this option  is
              simply ignored.

       -h, --help

              Print this help message.

       -V, --version

              Show version information.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
       <FILE>...

              Files  to print and concatenate. Use a dash ('-') or no argument
              at all to read from standard input.

SUBCOMMANDS
       cache - Modify the syntax-definition and theme cache.

FILES
       bat can also be customized with a configuration file. The  location  of
       the file is dependent on your operating system. To get the default path
       for your system, call:

       bat --config-file

       Alternatively, you can use the BAT_CONFIG_PATH environment variable  to
       point bat to a non-default location of the configuration file.

       To generate a default configuration file, call:

       bat --generate-config-file

ADDING CUSTOM LANGUAGES
       bat  supports  Sublime  Text .sublime-syntax language files, and can be
       customized to add additional languages to your local  installation.  To
       do  this,  add  the  .sublime-syntax language files to `$(bat --config-
       dir)/syntaxes` and run `bat cache --build`.

       Example:

            mkdir -p ""$(bat --config-dir)/syntaxes""
            cd ""$(bat --config-dir)/syntaxes""

            # Put new '.sublime-syntax' language definition files
            # in this folder (or its subdirectories), for example:
            git clone https://github.com/tellnobody1/sublime-purescript-syntax

            # And then build the cache.
            bat cache --build

       Once  the  cache  is  built,  the  new language will be visible in `bat
       --list-languages`.
       If you ever want to remove the custom  languages,  you  can  clear  the
       cache with `bat cache --clear`.


ADDING CUSTOM THEMES
       Similarly  to  custom  languages,  bat  supports  Sublime Text .tmTheme
       themes.  These can be installed to  `$(bat  --config-dir)/themes`,  and
       are added to the cache with `bat cache --build`.

## Pre-release checks

- [x] Push all changes and wait for CI to succeed (before continuing with the
      next section).
- [x] Optional: manually test the new features and command-line options. To do
      this, install the latest `bat` version again (to include the new syntaxes
      and themes).
- [x] Run `cargo publish --dry-run --allow-dirty` to make sure that it will
      succeed later (after creating the GitHub release).

## Release

- [x] Create a tag and push it: `git tag vX.Y.Z; git push origin tag vX.Y.Z`.
      This will trigger the deployment via GitHub Actions.
- [x] Go to https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/releases/new to create the new
      release. Select the new tag and also use it as the release title. For the
      release notes, copy the corresponding section from `CHANGELOG.md` and
      possibly add additional remarks for package maintainers.
      Publish the release.
- [x] Check if the binary deployment works (archives and Debian packages should
      appear when the CI run for the Git tag has finished).
- [x] Publish to crates.io by running `cargo publish` in a *clean* repository.

2019,"CHANGELOG.md: Prepare a new ""unreleased"" section",This finalizes the making of the v0.19.0 release (see checklist at https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/pull/2016) :tada: ,48,116,2022-01-08 18:46:36+00:00,2022-01-08 19:05:43+00:00,2022-01-08 19:20:23+00:00,2022-01-08 19:05:43+00:00,closed,True,0,1,15,0,1,15,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,sharkdp/bat
2029,Contribute new 8-bit theme: Ansi 16,"I've been working on an adaptation of [base16](http://chriskempson.com/projects/base16/) to solve a few compatibility issues: [Ansi 16](https://github.com/chtenb/ansi16). 

- In contrast with the base16 highlighting scheme, Ansi 16 will work well with any ANSI terminal color theme and does not require that the bright colors are set to a specific scheme. In fact, the Ansi 16 guidelines encourage that the bright colors be compatible with the non-bright colors.
- In contrast with the pre-included `ansi` theme, Ansi 16 *does* make use of the bright ANSI colors, not just the first 8 base colors.

I've put together a .tmTheme called `terminal-ansi16` that implements the Ansi16 scheme for bat. This is included in this PR. Apart from improving compatibility, the scope assignment rules are also more sophisticated than both the pre-included `ansi` and `base16` themes. You can judge this by comparing https://github.com/chtenb/ansi16/blob/0a16273296bbd5d7f5335d62e7605071743794a9/terminal-ansi16.tmTheme with https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/blob/master/assets/themes/ansi.tmTheme and by looking at the screenshot comparisons below.

After this PR has been merged I intend to release a short tutorial somewhere which explains how to use bat, delta and VSCode to create a development setup where the syntax highlighting is fully equivalent between the editor and the terminal.

To get an idea of what that looks like, you can take a look at screenshots of the [VSCode theme I just released.](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ctenbrinke.ansi16) These themes set the integrated terminal theme to the same color palette as their in-editor theme. I've used the .tmTheme included in this PR for the diff views (using delta) in the terminal.",35,1762,2022-01-15 15:33:31+00:00,,2022-09-06 20:15:13+00:00,2022-09-06 20:15:12+00:00,closed,False,19,7,9,0,4,9,0,1,0,3,3,2,3,4,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,sharkdp/bat

2058,run-benchmarks.sh: Use `python3` oneliner instead of `jq`,"I am setting up a new computer and thus are missing a lot of tools. I
noticed we rely on `jq` being installed, which is a bit annoying when it
is not installed yet. That's easy enough to install on Linux, but on a fresh
macOS install it is not trivial to do. Partly because MacOS refuses to run
unsigned software by default.

We can quite easily get rid of this dependency on `jq` by using a simple
`python3` oneliner.

For reference, the dependency on `jq` was added in ea2faf45e4.

If you prefer to keep the `jq` dependency I am fine with that. Personally I
think it's nice to reduce dependencies  on external tools though. Python3 is of course also an external tool, but it is installed by default on both macOS and (practically) all Linux distributions.

(This is the only place we use `jq`)",57,809,2022-02-02 20:15:10+00:00,2022-02-03 07:00:15+00:00,2022-02-03 07:00:17+00:00,2022-02-03 07:00:15+00:00,closed,True,0,1,5,5,1,5,5,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,sharkdp/bat

JQ is a pretty well-known tool, so, hopefully this isn't too controversial to add.

2074,fix Bash completion on macOS,"Issue #2066 reports that bash completion is broken on macOS. This is because the version of `bash-completion` that's often packed on macOS via Home-brew is v1.3, which doesn't include the missing `_init_completion` function.

This PR adopts a pattern seen across many other projects (e.g. `tmux`/ `gh` / `kubectl` /  `helm`, some of which use the Cobra Go library to [autogenerate their completion](https://github.com/spf13/cobra/blob/master/bash_completionsV2.go#L32-L38)) to add a shim function with the minimal required functionality.

Completion now works for me on both macOS 10.15.7 and Ubuntu 22.04.

2088,release-checklist.md: Remove '## Dependencies',"I would like us to discuss removing the section in the release checklist that encourages (by merely being in the checklist) bumping of dependencies.

Bumping dependencies right before a release might not be the best strategy, because

* Bumping deps comes with a risk of introducing regressions (that are not caught by our regression tests). Letting bumps sit in git master for a few weeks or so increases the chances of that kind of regressions being found before we make a release.

* Dependabot regularly bumps dependencies anyway (which is also pointed out in the removed text)

* Ideally, it should be pleasant and easy to make a bat release. The fewer steps, the easier. Even if we mark steps as ""optional"", it is easy to get a bad conscious if you skip the steps, and thus even optional steps have some amount of ""slow down"".",46,840,2022-02-25 18:59:21+00:00,2022-02-26 16:08:32+00:00,2022-02-26 16:08:35+00:00,2022-02-26 16:08:32+00:00,closed,True,2,1,0,11,1,0,11,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,sharkdp/bat

2091,Prepare for v0.20.0,"I originally planned this as v0.19.1, but upon diffing with v0.19.0 in preparation for the release, I was reminded that we have made a semver breaking change, namely adding new enum variants to the `StyleComponent` enum which was not previously marked `#[non_exhaustive]`. So if we just bump to v0.19.1, client code that do currently exhaustive matches on `StyleComponent` will stop compiling.

So this release must be v0.20.0.

# Release checklist

## Version bump

- [x] Update version in `Cargo.toml`. Run `cargo build` to update `Cargo.lock`.
      Make sure to `git add` the `Cargo.lock` changes as well.
- [x] Find the current min. supported Rust version by running
      `grep '^\s*MIN_SUPPORTED_RUST_VERSION' .github/workflows/CICD.yml`.
- [x] Update the version and the min. supported Rust version in `README.md` and
      `doc/README-*.md`. Check with `git grep -i 'rust.*1\.'` and
      `git grep -i '1\..*rust'`.
- [x] Update `CHANGELOG.md`. Introduce a section for the new release.

## Update syntaxes and themes (build assets)

- [x] Install the latest master version (`cargo clean && cargo install -f --path .`) and make
      sure that it is available on the `PATH` (`bat --version` should show the
      new version).

```
% bat --version
bat 0.20.0 (5f04c1d)
```

- [x] Run `assets/create.sh` and check in the binary asset files.

## Documentation

- [x] Review the `-h` and `--help` texts

```

% bat --help
bat 0.20.0 (5f04c1d)
A cat(1) clone with syntax highlighting and Git integration.

USAGE:
    bat [OPTIONS] [FILE]...
    bat <SUBCOMMAND>

OPTIONS:
    -A, --show-all
            Show non-printable characters like space, tab or newline. This option can also be
            used to print binary files. Use '--tabs' to control the width of the tab-
            placeholders.
    -p, --plain                                 
            Only show plain style, no decorations. This is an alias for '--style=plain'. When
            '-p' is used twice ('-pp'), it also disables automatic paging (alias for
            '--style=plain --pager=never').
    -l, --language <language>                   
            Explicitly set the language for syntax highlighting. The language can be specified as
            a name (like 'C++' or 'LaTeX') or possible file extension (like 'cpp', 'hpp' or
            'md'). Use '--list-languages' to show all supported language names and file
            extensions.
    -H, --highlight-line <N:M>...               
            Highlight the specified line ranges with a different background color For example:
              '--highlight-line 40' highlights line 40
              '--highlight-line 30:40' highlights lines 30 to 40
              '--highlight-line :40' highlights lines 1 to 40
              '--highlight-line 40:' highlights lines 40 to the end of the file
              '--highlight-line 30:+10' highlights lines 30 to 40
        --file-name <name>...                   
            Specify the name to display for a file. Useful when piping data to bat from STDIN
            when bat does not otherwise know the filename. Note that the provided file name is
            also used for syntax detection.
    -d, --diff
            Only show lines that have been added/removed/modified with respect to the Git index.
            Use --diff-context=N to control how much context you want to see.
        --diff-context <N>                      
            Include N lines of context around added/removed/modified lines when using '--diff'.

        --tabs <T>                              
            Set the tab width to T spaces. Use a width of 0 to pass tabs through directly

        --wrap <mode>
            Specify the text-wrapping mode (*auto*, never, character). The '--terminal-width'
            option can be used in addition to control the output width.
        --terminal-width <width>
            Explicitly set the width of the terminal instead of determining it automatically. If
            prefixed with '+' or '-', the value will be treated as an offset to the actual
            terminal width. See also: '--wrap'.
    -n, --number                                
            Only show line numbers, no other decorations. This is an alias for '--style=numbers'

        --color <when>                          
            Specify when to use colored output. The automatic mode only enables colors if an
            interactive terminal is detected - colors are automatically disabled if the output
            goes to a pipe.
            Possible values: *auto*, never, always.
        --italic-text <when>                    
            Specify when to use ANSI sequences for italic text in the output. Possible values:
            always, *never*.
        --decorations <when>
            Specify when to use the decorations that have been specified via '--style'. The
            automatic mode only enables decorations if an interactive terminal is detected.
            Possible values: *auto*, never, always.
    -f, --force-colorization                    
            Alias for '--decorations=always --color=always'. This is useful if the output of bat
            is piped to another program, but you want to keep the colorization/decorations.
        --paging <when>
            Specify when to use the pager. To disable the pager, use --paging=never' or its
            alias,'-P'. To disable the pager permanently, set BAT_PAGER to an empty string. To
            control which pager is used, see the '--pager' option. Possible values: *auto*,
            never, always.
        --pager <command>                       
            Determine which pager is used. This option will override the PAGER and BAT_PAGER
            environment variables. The default pager is 'less'. To control when the pager is
            used, see the '--paging' option. Example: '--pager ""less -RF""'.
    -m, --map-syntax <glob:syntax>...
            Map a glob pattern to an existing syntax name. The glob pattern is matched on the
            full path and the filename. For example, to highlight *.build files with the Python
            syntax, use -m '*.build:Python'. To highlight files named '.myignore' with the Git
            Ignore syntax, use -m '.myignore:Git Ignore'. Note that the right-hand side is the
            *name* of the syntax, not a file extension.
        --ignored-suffix <ignored-suffix>...
            Ignore extension. For example:
              'bat --ignored-suffix "".dev"" my_file.json.dev' will use JSON syntax, and ignore
            '.dev'
        --theme <theme>                         
            Set the theme for syntax highlighting. Use '--list-themes' to see all available
            themes. To set a default theme, add the '--theme=""...""' option to the configuration
            file or export the BAT_THEME environment variable (e.g.: export BAT_THEME=""..."").
        --list-themes                           
            Display a list of supported themes for syntax highlighting.

        --style <components>
            Configure which elements (line numbers, file headers, grid borders, Git
            modifications, ..) to display in addition to the file contents. The argument is a
            comma-separated list of components to display (e.g. 'numbers,changes,grid') or a pre-
            defined style ('full'). To set a default style, add the '--style=""..""' option to
            the configuration file or export the BAT_STYLE environment variable (e.g.: export
            BAT_STYLE="".."").
            
            Possible values:
            
              * full: enables all available components (default).
              * auto: same as 'full', unless the output is piped.
              * plain: disables all available components.
              * changes: show Git modification markers.
              * header: alias for 'header-filename'.
              * header-filename: show filenames before the content.
              * header-filesize: show file sizes before the content.
              * grid: vertical/horizontal lines to separate side bar
                      and the header from the content.
              * rule: horizontal lines to delimit files.
              * numbers: show line numbers in the side bar.
              * snip: draw separation lines between distinct line ranges.
    -r, --line-range <N:M>...                   
            Only print the specified range of lines for each file. For example:
              '--line-range 30:40' prints lines 30 to 40
              '--line-range :40' prints lines 1 to 40
              '--line-range 40:' prints lines 40 to the end of the file
              '--line-range 40' only prints line 40
              '--line-range 30:+10' prints lines 30 to 40
    -L, --list-languages                        
            Display a list of supported languages for syntax highlighting.

    -u, --unbuffered                            
            This option exists for POSIX-compliance reasons ('u' is for 'unbuffered'). The output
            is always unbuffered - this option is simply ignored.
        --diagnostic                            
            Show diagnostic information for bug reports.

        --acknowledgements                      
            Show acknowledgements.

    -h, --help

BAT(1)                       General Commands Manual                      BAT(1)



NAME
       bat - a cat(1) clone with syntax highlighting and Git integration.

USAGE
       bat [OPTIONS] [FILE]...

       bat cache [CACHE-OPTIONS] [--build|--clear]

DESCRIPTION
       bat prints the syntax-highlighted content of a collection of FILEs to the
       terminal. If no FILE is specified, or when FILE is '-', it reads from
       standard input.

       bat supports a large number of programming and markup languages.  It also
       communicates with git(1) to show modifications with respect to the git
       index.  bat automatically pipes its output through a pager (by default:
       less).

       Whenever the output of bat goes to a non-interactive terminal, i.e. when
       the output is piped into another process or into a file, bat will act as
       a drop-in replacement for cat(1) and fall back to printing the plain file
       contents.


OPTIONS
       General remarks: Command-line options like '-l'/'--language' that take
       values can be specified as either '--language value', '--language=value',
       '-l value' or '-lvalue'.

       -A, --show-all

              Show non-printable characters like space, tab or newline. Use
              '--tabs' to control the width of the tab-placeholders.

       -p, --plain

              Only show plain style, no decorations. This is an alias for
              '--style=plain'. When '-p' is used twice ('-pp'), it also disables
              automatic paging (alias for '--style=plain --pager=never').

       -l, --language <language>

              Explicitly set the language for syntax highlighting. The language
              can be specified as a name (like 'C++' or 'LaTeX') or possible
              file extension (like 'cpp', 'hpp' or 'md'). Use '--list-languages'
              to show all supported language names and file extensions.

       -H, --highlight-line <N:M>...

              Highlight the specified line ranges with a different background
              color. For example:

              --highlight-line 40
                     highlights line 40

              --highlight-line 30:40
                     highlights lines 30 to 40

              --highlight-line :40
                     highlights lines 1 to 40

              --highlight-line 40:
                     highlights lines 40 to the end of the file

              --highlight-line 30:+10
                     highlights lines 30 to 40

       --file-name <name>...

              Specify the name to display for a file. Useful when piping data to
              bat from STDIN when bat does not otherwise know the filename. Note
              that the provided file name is also used for syntax detection.

       -d, --diff

              Only show lines that have been added/removed/modified with respect
              to the Git index. Use '--diff-context=N' to control how much
              context you want to see.

       --diff-context <N>...

              Include N lines of context around added/removed/modified lines
              when using '--diff'.

       --tabs <T>

              Set the tab width to T spaces. Use a width of 0 to pass tabs
              through directly

       --wrap <mode>

              Specify the text-wrapping mode (*auto*, never, character). The
              '--terminal-width' option can be used in addition to control the
              output width.

       --terminal-width <width>

              Explicitly set the width of the terminal instead of determining it
              automatically. If prefixed with '+' or '-', the value will be
              treated as an offset to the actual terminal width. See also:
              '--wrap'.

       -n, --number

              Only show line numbers, no other decorations. This is an alias for
              '--style=numbers'

       --color <when>

              Specify when to use colored output. The automatic mode only
              enables colors if an interactive terminal is detected. Possible
              values: *auto*, never, always.

       --italic-text <when>

              Specify when to use ANSI sequences for italic text in the output.
              Possible values: always, *never*.

       --decorations <when>

              Specify when to use the decorations that have been specified via
              '--style'. The automatic mode only enables decorations if an
              interactive terminal is detected. Possible values: *auto*, never,
              always.

       -f, --force-colorization

              Alias for '--decorations=always --color=always'. This is useful if
              the output of bat is piped to another program, but you want to
              keep the colorization/decorations.

       --paging <when>

              Specify when to use the pager. To disable the pager, use
              '--paging=never' or its alias, -P. To disable the pager
              permanently, set BAT_PAGER to an empty string. To control which
              pager is used, see the '--pager' option. Possible values: *auto*,
              never, always.

       --pager <command>

              Determine which pager is used. This option will override the PAGER
              and BAT_PAGER environment variables. The default pager is 'less'.
              To control when the pager is used, see the '--paging' option.
              Example: '--pager ""less -RF""'.

              Note: By default, if the pager is set to 'less' (and no command-
              line options are specified), 'bat' will pass the following command
              line options to the pager: '-R'/'--RAW-CONTROL-CHARS',
              '-F'/'--quit-if-one-screen' and '-X'/'--no-init'. The last option
              ('-X') is only used for 'less' versions older than 530. The '-R'
              option is needed to interpret ANSI colors correctly. The second
              option ('-F') instructs less to exit immediately if the output
              size is smaller than the vertical size of the terminal. This is
              convenient for small files because you do not have to press 'q' to
              quit the pager. The third option ('-X') is needed to fix a bug
              with the '--quit-if-one-screen' feature in old versions of 'less'.
              Unfortunately, it also breaks mouse-wheel support in 'less'. If
              you want to enable mouse-wheel scrolling on older versions of
              'less', you can pass just '-R' (as in the example above, this will
              disable the quit-if-one-screen feature). For less 530 or newer, it
              should work out of the box.

       -m, --map-syntax <glob-pattern:syntax-name>...

              Map a glob pattern to an existing syntax name. The glob pattern is
              matched on the full path and the filename. For example, to
              highlight *.build files with the Python syntax, use -m
              '*.build:Python'. To highlight files named '.myignore' with the
              Git Ignore syntax, use -m '.myignore:Git Ignore'.  Note that the
              right-hand side is the *name* of the syntax, not a file extension.

       --theme <theme>

              Set the theme for syntax highlighting. Use '--list-themes' to see
              all available themes.  To set a default theme, add the
              '--theme=""...""' option to the configuration file or export the
              BAT_THEME environment variable (e.g.: export BAT_THEME=""..."").

       --list-themes

              Display a list of supported themes for syntax highlighting.

       --style <style-components>

              Configure which elements (line numbers, file headers, grid
              borders, Git modifications, ..) to display in addition to the file
              contents. The argument is a comma-separated list of components to
              display (e.g. 'numbers,changes,grid') or a pre-defined style
              ('full').  To set a default style, add the '--style=""..""' option
              to the configuration file or export the BAT_STYLE environment
              variable (e.g.: export BAT_STYLE=""..""). Possible values: *full*,
              auto, plain, changes, header, header-filename, header-filesize,
              grid, rule, numbers, snip.

       -r, --line-range <N:M>...

              Only print the specified range of lines for each file. For
              example:

              --line-range 30:40
                     prints lines 30 to 40

              --line-range :40
                     prints lines 1 to 40

              --line-range 40:
                     prints lines 40 to the end of the file

              --line-range 30:+10
                     prints lines 30 to 40

       -L, --list-languages

              Display a list of supported languages for syntax highlighting.

       -u, --unbuffered

              This option exists for POSIX-compliance reasons ('u' is for
              'unbuffered'). The output is always unbuffered - this option is
              simply ignored.

       -h, --help

              Print this help message.

       -V, --version

              Show version information.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
       <FILE>...

              Files to print and concatenate. Use a dash ('-') or no argument at
              all to read from standard input.

SUBCOMMANDS
       cache - Modify the syntax-definition and theme cache.

FILES
       bat can also be customized with a configuration file. The location of the
       file is dependent on your operating system. To get the default path for
       your system, call:

       bat --config-file

       Alternatively, you can use the BAT_CONFIG_PATH environment variable to
       point bat to a non-default location of the configuration file.

       To generate a default configuration file, call:

       bat --generate-config-file

ADDING CUSTOM LANGUAGES
       bat supports Sublime Text .sublime-syntax language files, and can be
       customized to add additional languages to your local installation. To do
       this, add the .sublime-syntax language files to `$(bat --config-
       dir)/syntaxes` and run `bat cache --build`.

       Example:

            mkdir -p ""$(bat --config-dir)/syntaxes""
            cd ""$(bat --config-dir)/syntaxes""

            # Put new '.sublime-syntax' language definition files
            # in this folder (or its subdirectories), for example:
            git clone https://github.com/tellnobody1/sublime-purescript-syntax

            # And then build the cache.
            bat cache --build

       Once the cache is built, the new language will be visible in `bat --list-
       languages`.
       If you ever want to remove the custom languages, you can clear the cache
       with `bat cache --clear`.


ADDING CUSTOM THEMES
       Similarly to custom languages, bat supports Sublime Text .tmTheme themes.
       These can be installed to `$(bat --config-dir)/themes`, and are added to
       the cache with `bat cache --build`.

```

## Pre-release checks

- [x] Push all changes and wait for CI to succeed (before continuing with the
      next section).
- [x] Optional: manually test the new features and command-line options. To do
      this, install the latest `bat` version again (to include the new syntaxes
      and themes).
- [x] Run `cargo publish --dry-run --allow-dirty` to make sure that it will
      succeed later (after creating the GitHub release).

## Release

- [x] Create a tag and push it: `git tag vX.Y.Z; git push origin tag vX.Y.Z`.
      This will trigger the deployment via GitHub Actions.
- [x] Go to https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/releases/new to create the new
      release. Select the new tag and also use it as the release title. For the
      release notes, copy the corresponding section from `CHANGELOG.md` and
      possibly add additional remarks for package maintainers.
      Publish the release.
- [x] Check if the binary deployment works (archives and Debian packages should
      appear when the CI run for the Git tag has finished).
- [x] Publish to crates.io by running `cargo publish` in a *clean* repository.
      The safest way to do this is to clone a fresh copy.

## Post-release

- [x] Prepare a new (empty) ""unreleased"" section at the top of `CHANGELOG.md`.

I added a new --style=default option that is effectively a carbon copy of --style=full, only I've taken out the file size in the header. I expect there to be more differences going forward, e.g. after implementing some of #1701.

I added a simple integration test that seems to pass okay, and updated the shell completions (though I only use bash so I haven't tested them).

I am brand spanking new to Rust, so apologies if I'm way out of line here.

When we have access to https://github.com/sharkdp/bugreport/pull/11 we will be able to get even more info for custom assets, but the metadata is a significant giver of valuable information by itself that we can add already now to `bat`, so let's do that.

<summary>Changelog</summary>
<p><em>Sourced from <a href=""https://github.com/matklad/once_cell/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md"">once_cell's changelog</a>.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<h1>Changelog</h1>
<h2>1.11</h2>
<ul>
<li>Add <code>OnceCell::with_value</code> to create initialized <code>OnceCell</code> at compile time.</li>
<li>Improve <code>Clone</code> implementation for <code>OnceCell</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>1.10</h2>
<ul>
<li>upgrade <code>parking_lot</code> to <code>0.12.0</code> (note that this bumps MSRV with <code>parking_lot</code> feature enabled to <code>1.49.0</code>).</li>
</ul>
<h2>1.9</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added an <code>atomic-polyfill</code> optional dependency to compile <code>race</code> on platforms without atomics</li>
</ul>
<h2>1.8.0</h2>
<ul>
<li>Add <code>try_insert</code> API -- a version of <code>set</code> that returns a reference.</li>
</ul>
<h2>1.7.2</h2>
<ul>
<li>Improve code size when using parking_lot feature.</li>
</ul>
<h2>1.7.1</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fix <code>race::OnceBox&lt;T&gt;</code> to also impl <code>Default</code> even if <code>T</code> doesn't impl <code>Default</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>1.7.0</h2>
<ul>
<li>Hide the <code>race</code> module behind (default) <code>race</code> feature.
Turns out that adding <code>race</code> by default was a breaking change on some platforms without atomics.
In this release, we make the module opt-out.
Technically, this is a breaking change for those who use <code>race</code> with <code>no_default_features</code>.
Given that the <code>race</code> module itself only several days old, the breakage is deemed acceptable.</li>
</ul>
<h2>1.6.0</h2>
<ul>
<li>Add <code>Lazy::into_value</code></li>
<li>Stabilize <code>once_cell::race</code> module for &quot;first one wins&quot; no_std-compatible initialization flavor.</li>
<li>Migrate from deprecated <code>compare_and_swap</code> to <code>compare_exchange</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>1.5.2</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>OnceBox</code> API uses <code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code>.
This a breaking change to unstable API.</li>
</ul>
<h2>1.5.1</h2>
<ul>
<li>MSRV is increased to <code>1.36.0</code>.</li>
<li>document <code>once_cell::race</code> module.</li>
</ul>

<h1>1.5.5 (2022-03-08)</h1>
<p>This releases fixes a security bug in the regex compiler. This bug permits a
vector for a denial-of-service attack in cases where the regex being compiled
is untrusted. There are no known problems where the regex is itself trusted,
including in cases of untrusted haystacks.</p>

Fixes a bug in the regex compiler where empty sub-expressions subverted the
existing mitigations in place to enforce a size limit on compiled regexes.

2142,Allow configuring show_nonprintable from PrettyPrinter,"This PR allows crates using `bat` as a library to configure the `show_nonprintable` setting via the `PrettyPrinter` API.

Note that it is possible to use `bat` as a lib and configure this, but the workaround requires using `bat`'s ""inner"" API which is discouraged by `bat`'s documentation.

Current workaround:

```rs
let mut config = bat::config::Config::default();
config.show_nonprintable = true;
let assets = bat::assets::HighlightingAssets::from_binary();
let ctrl = bat::controller::Controller::new(&config, &assets);
let inp = bat::input::Input::from(bat::Input::from_bytes(&output));
ctrl.run(vec![inp]).unwrap();
```

Once this PR is merged, consumers will be able to do this:

```rs
bat::PrettyPrinter::new()
    .input_from_bytes(&output)
    .show_nonprintable(true)
    .print()
    .expect(""Failed to print to STDOUT"");
```

---

**Something else noteworthy**: if using `bat` as a library, if binary content is detected then the `PrettyPrinter` will print:

```
[bat warning]: Binary content from READER will not be printed to the terminal (but will be present if the output of 'bat' is piped). You can use 'bat -A' to show the binary file contents.
```

I'm not sure if this has been discussed previously, but I imagine it could cause some surprise for crates which depend on `bat` since the `-A` flag obviously isn't available, etc.",54,1381,2022-04-01 11:10:24+00:00,2022-04-02 19:05:37+00:00,2022-04-03 03:35:05+00:00,2022-04-02 19:05:37+00:00,closed,True,7,2,7,0,2,7,0,0,0,2,2,1,2,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,sharkdp/bat

IMO this problem is not a blocker to get the v0.21.0 release out since this is not a change in behaviour compared to v0.20.0.

The main use case for the old code seems to be that colored input across newlines should be handled correctly. If you try this:

```
echo ""\x1B[33mColor\nColor \x1B[m\nPlain\n"" | ./target/debug/bat
```

it looks like this with `cat`:

<img width=""469"" alt=""Skärmavbild 2022-05-10 kl  08 42 04"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115040/167564591-4403187a-eb4e-4842-acf8-876a97d80834.png"">

and the same with the latest release of `bat`, but with the code in this PR it looks like this instead:

since we reset colors when we encounter `\n` it seems. But IMHO we should just consider ANSI escape inputs as out-of-scope for bat, since syntax highlighting is broken when input contains ANSI escape characters anyway.

# Release checklist

## Version bump

- [x] Update version in `Cargo.toml`. Run `cargo build` to update `Cargo.lock`.
      Make sure to `git add` the `Cargo.lock` changes as well.
- [x] Find the current min. supported Rust version by running
      `grep '^\s*MIN_SUPPORTED_RUST_VERSION' .github/workflows/CICD.yml`.
- [x] Update the version and the min. supported Rust version in `README.md` and
      `doc/README-*.md`. Check with
      `git grep -i -e 'rust.*1\.' -e '1\..*rust' | grep README | grep -v tests/`.
- [x] Update `CHANGELOG.md`. Introduce a section for the new release.

## Update syntaxes and themes (build assets)

- [x] Install the latest master version (`cargo clean && cargo install --locked -f --path .`) and make
      sure that it is available on the `PATH` (`bat --version` should show the
      new version).
- [x] Run `assets/create.sh` and check in the binary asset files.

## Documentation

- [x] Review `-h`, `--help`, and the `man` page. All of these are shown in
      the output of the CI job called *Documentation*, so look there.
      The CI workflow corresponding to the tip of the master branch is a good place to look.

## Pre-release checks

- [x] Push all changes and wait for CI to succeed (before continuing with the
      next section).
- [ ] Optional: manually test the new features and command-line options. To do
      this, install the latest `bat` version again (to include the new syntaxes
      and themes).
- [x] Run `cargo publish --dry-run` to make sure that it will
      succeed later (after creating the GitHub release).

## Release

- [x] Create a tag and push it: `git tag vX.Y.Z; git push origin tag vX.Y.Z`.
      This will trigger the deployment via GitHub Actions.
      REMINDER: If your `origin` is a fork, don't forget to push to e.g. `upstream` instead!
- [x] Go to https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/releases/new to create the new
      release. Select the new tag and also use it as the release title. For the
      release notes, copy the corresponding section from `CHANGELOG.md` and
      possibly add additional remarks for package maintainers.
      Publish the release.
- [x] Check if the binary deployment works (archives and Debian packages should
      appear when the CI run for the Git tag has finished).
- [x] Publish to crates.io by running `cargo publish` in a *clean* repository.
      The safest way to do this is to clone a fresh copy.

## Post-release

- [x] Prepare a new ""unreleased"" section at the top of `CHANGELOG.md`.

2197,Make the default macOS theme depend on Dark Mode,"We frequently get complaints from macOS users that bat does not work on
their default macOS terminal background, which is white.

Pay the price of slightly increased startup time to get a better default
on macOS. To avoid the slightly increased startup time, simply
specify a theme explicitly via `--theme`, `BAT_THEME`, or
`~/.config/bat`.

I did some quick testing, and it seems to work. With Dark Mode:

<img width=""762"" alt=""Skärmavbild 2022-05-21 kl  18 22 52"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115040/169661101-61db3557-43ea-4a96-9f23-be4aa4896fd3.png"">

With default system theme:

<img width=""775"" alt=""Skärmavbild 2022-05-21 kl  18 22 33"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115040/169661107-6de4a82f-a600-4bd2-908c-b570fb751fbc.png"">

Startup time is increased slightly due to this check:

| Command | Mean [ms] | Min [ms] | Max [ms] | Relative |
|:---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `./target/release/bat -f examples/simple.rs` | 12.9 ± 1.3 | 12.1 | 23.2 | 1.50 ± 0.16 |
| `bat-v0.21.0 -f examples/simple.rs` | 8.6 ± 0.2 | 8.3 | 9.3 | 1.00 |

But there is no difference if an explicit theme is selected:

| Command | Mean [ms] | Min [ms] | Max [ms] | Relative |
|:---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `./target/release/bat -f --theme ""Monokai Extended"" examples/simple.rs` | 8.7 ± 0.2 | 8.3 | 9.5 | 1.00 |
| `bat-v0.21.0 -f --theme ""Monokai Extended"" examples/simple.rs` | 8.7 ± 0.6 | 8.3 | 19.0 | 1.01 ± 0.08 |

Note that if there is an error when we check if Dark Mode is enabled, we
behave the same as on Windows and Linux; assume that the terminal
background is dark. This harmonizes behavior across platforms, and makes
bat behave the same as before, when Dark Mode was always assumed to be
enabled.

2203,Proof of concept: Lua plugins,"This is a proof-of-concept implementation of something that we discussed amongst the maintainers recently: a **plugin mechanism for bat**. The idea of this PR is to get the discussion started. And to answer a few questions. Most importantly: do we really want/need this?

This whole idea came up because there are a lot of feature requests that keep popping up on `bat`s issue tracker that we previously always declined, mostly because we wanted to keep `bat` focused on its core functionality. And because of the additional maintenance overhead:
- **gzip support** (#237, #642, #748, #2188)
- **CURL support** (#4, #2070)
- **`bat <directory>` support** (#427, #971, #1156, #1940)
- **View binary files as hex dump** (#619, #800, #1554)
- **Pretty printing** (#565, #1592, #2191)

On the other hand, most of these functionalities *are* actually quite useful! A lot of workarounds have been suggested. Lots of people wrote their own wrapper functions. And with [bat-extras](https://github.com/eth-p/bat-extras), we even have a dedicated project working on extending `bat`s functionality. The ""problem"" with all of these solutions is that they are not directly included in `bat`, so you need to remember the name of the wrapper scripts. And you need to install them separately.

Here, we try to follow a different approach: instead of forcing users to wrap `bat`, we enable users to *add functionality to bat* by providing a plugin mechanism. We could still maintain those plugins here in this repository. But (1) we could easily argue that those plugins are not part of `bat`s core functionality, especially if all of them would be opt-in (2) it would be easier to maintain this functionality... or to throw it out again. And (3), users could easily customize those plugins or write their own.

In this PoC, plugins can be enabled by adding lines like the following to your `bat` config file:
```bash
--load-plugin ""uncompress.lua""
--load-plugin ""curl.lua""
--load-plugin ""directories.lua""
```
Plugins are written in Lua. For now, there is just one type of plugin: a ""preprocess"" plugin that can modify the input to `bat`. These plugins have to provide a `preprocess` function that will be called for every input path to `bat`. The plugins then have the option to *return a different path* instead. This can be used to hand back paths to temporary files with the output of the preprocessing. For example, `directories.lua` looks like this:
```lua
function preprocess(path)
    if is_dir(path) then
        tmpfile = os.tmpname()
        os.execute(""ls -alh --color=always '"" .. path .. ""' > '"" .. tmpfile .. ""'"")
        return tmpfile
    else
        return path
    end
end
```
Obviously, *this is not a great plugin architecture*. It's extremely restrictive. And the interface between `bat` and the plugins is very limited. I could easily imagine a lot of different things that we would like to expose to the plugins. Or functionality that we would like to provide (e.g. to add new command-line options to `bat`). But it's somewhat surprising that this simple interface is (up to a few limitations) powerful enough to handle four of the five feature requests listed above:

## Executable size, Benchmarks

I chose Lua because I heard that it is cheap to embed it into existing applications. And also fast. I have never programmed in Lua until today, so I would have probably have preferred another scripting language personally. But I don't think we want to ship a Python interpreter with `bat`.

But obviously, this still comes with some overhead in terms of binary size:
```
bat-master: 4.69 MB (4,685,824 bytes)
bat-2203:   5.05 MB (5,050,368 bytes)
```

Concerning startup time: the overhead here seems to be pretty much negligible. With three plugins activated and executed (but in the trivial ""don't touch this path"" mode) and 22 input files passed to `bat` (i.e. 3 x 22 = 66 Lua function invocations), we get a slowdown of less than a millisecond:

| Command | Mean [ms] | Min [ms] | Max [ms] | Relative |
|:---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `./bat-master src/*.rs` | 5.2 ± 0.4 | 4.5 | 7.4 | 1.00 |
| `./bat-2203 src/*.rs` | 5.6 ± 0.4 | 4.9 | 7.9 | 1.08 ± 0.12 |

2222,Make `bat::PrettyPrinter::syntaxes()` iterate over new `bat::Syntax` struct,"We can't keep `syntect::parsing::SyntaxReference` as part of the public API, because that might prevent us from bumping to syntect 6.0.0 without also bumping bat to v2.0.0.

So introduce a new stripped down struct `Syntax` and return that instead. Let it be fully owned to make the API simple. It is not going to be in a hot code path anyway.

I have looked at all code of our 27 dependents but I can't find a single instance of this method being used, so this change should be safe for v1.0.0. It is only used in our own example code as far as I can tell.

For reference (mostly to my future self), here is the script I used to download the code of all dependents. Then one can grep around in the code of dependents:

```bash
#/usr/bin/env bash

# curl -L 'https://crates.io/api/v1/crates/bat/reverse_dependencies' | jq --raw-output '.versions | map(.crate) | flatten[]'
# curl -L 'https://crates.io/api/v1/crates/bat/reverse_dependencies?page=2' | jq --raw-output '.versions | map(.crate) | flatten[]'

2256,Bump serde_yaml from 0.8.24 to 0.9.2,"Bumps [serde_yaml](https://github.com/dtolnay/serde-yaml) from 0.8.24 to 0.9.2.
<details>
<summary>Release notes</summary>
<p><em>Sourced from <a href=""https://github.com/dtolnay/serde-yaml/releases"">serde_yaml's releases</a>.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<h2>0.9.2</h2>
<ul>
<li>Improve <code>Debug</code> representation of <code>serde_yaml::Error</code></li>
</ul>
<h2>0.9.1</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fix panic on some documents containing syntax error (<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/dtolnay/serde-yaml/issues/293"">#293</a>)</li>
<li>Improve error messages that used to contain duplicative line/column information (<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/dtolnay/serde-yaml/issues/294"">#294</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h2>0.9.0</h2>
<p><em>API documentation: <a href=""https://docs.rs/serde_yaml/0.9"">https://docs.rs/serde_yaml/0.9</a></em></p>
<h3>Highlights</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <code>serde_yaml::Value</code> enum gains a <code>Tagged</code> variant which represents the deserialization of YAML's <code>!Tag</code> syntax. Tagged scalars, sequences, and mappings are all supported.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An empty YAML input (or document containing only comments) will deserialize successfully to an empty map, empty sequence, or Serde struct as long as the struct has only optional fields. Previously this would error.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A new <code>.apply_merge()</code> method on <code>Value</code> implements YAML's <code>&lt;&lt;</code> merge key convention.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>Debug</code> representation of <code>serde_yaml::Value</code> has gotten vastly better (<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/dtolnay/serde-yaml/pull/287"">dtolnay/serde-yaml#287</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deserialization of borrowed strings now works.</p>
<pre lang=""rust""><code>#[derive(Deserialize, Debug)]
struct Struct&lt;'a&gt; {
    borrowed: &amp;'a str,
}
<p>let yaml = &quot;borrowed: 'kölcsönzött'\n&quot;;
let value: Struct = serde_yaml::from_str(yaml)?;
println!(&quot;{:#?}&quot;, value);
</code></pre></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Value</code>'s and <code>Mapping</code>'s methods <code>get</code> and <code>get_mut</code> have been generalized to support a &amp;str argument, as opposed to requiring you to allocate and construct a <code>Value::String</code> for indexing into another existing <code>Value</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Mapping</code> exposes more APIs that have become conventional on map data structures, such as <code>.keys()</code>, <code>.values()</code>, <code>.into_keys()</code>, <code>.into_values()</code>, <code>.values_mut()</code>, and <code>.retain(|k, v| …)</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Breaking changes</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Serialization no longer produces leading <code>---\n</code> on the serialized output. You can prepend this yourself if your use case demands it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Serialization of enum variants is now based on YAML's <code>!Tag</code> syntax, rather than JSON-style singleton maps.</p>
<pre lang=""rust""><code>#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
enum Enum {
    Newtype(usize),
    Tuple(usize, usize, usize),
    Struct { x: f64, y: f64 },
}
</code></pre>

<details>
<summary>Release notes</summary>
<p><em>Sourced from <a href=""https://github.com/dtolnay/serde-yaml/releases"">serde_yaml's releases</a>.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<h2>0.9.4</h2>
<ul>
<li>Add <code>serde_yaml::with::singleton_map</code> for serialization of enums as a 1-entry map (<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/dtolnay/serde-yaml/issues/300"">#300</a>)</li>
<li>Reject duplicate keys when deserializing <code>Mapping</code> or <code>Value</code> (<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/dtolnay/serde-yaml/issues/301"">#301</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h2>0.9.3</h2>
<ul>
<li>Add categories to crates.io metadata</li>
<li>Add keywords to crates.io metadata</li>
</ul>
<h2>0.9.2</h2>
<ul>
<li>Improve <code>Debug</code> representation of <code>serde_yaml::Error</code></li>
</ul>
<h2>0.9.1</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fix panic on some documents containing syntax error (<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/dtolnay/serde-yaml/issues/293"">#293</a>)</li>
<li>Improve error messages that used to contain duplicative line/column information (<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/dtolnay/serde-yaml/issues/294"">#294</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h2>0.9.0</h2>
<p><em>API documentation: <a href=""https://docs.rs/serde_yaml/0.9"">https://docs.rs/serde_yaml/0.9</a></em></p>
<h3>Highlights</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <code>serde_yaml::Value</code> enum gains a <code>Tagged</code> variant which represents the deserialization of YAML's <code>!Tag</code> syntax. Tagged scalars, sequences, and mappings are all supported.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An empty YAML input (or document containing only comments) will deserialize successfully to an empty map, empty sequence, or Serde struct as long as the struct has only optional fields. Previously this would error.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A new <code>.apply_merge()</code> method on <code>Value</code> implements YAML's <code>&lt;&lt;</code> merge key convention.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>Debug</code> representation of <code>serde_yaml::Value</code> has gotten vastly better (<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/dtolnay/serde-yaml/pull/287"">dtolnay/serde-yaml#287</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deserialization of borrowed strings now works.</p>
<pre lang=""rust""><code>#[derive(Deserialize, Debug)]
struct Struct&lt;'a&gt; {
    borrowed: &amp;'a str,
}
<p>let yaml = &quot;borrowed: 'kölcsönzött'\n&quot;;
let value: Struct = serde_yaml::from_str(yaml)?;
println!(&quot;{:#?}&quot;, value);
</code></pre></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Value</code>'s and <code>Mapping</code>'s methods <code>get</code> and <code>get_mut</code> have been generalized to support a &amp;str argument, as opposed to requiring you to allocate and construct a <code>Value::String</code> for indexing into another existing <code>Value</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Mapping</code> exposes more APIs that have become conventional on map data structures, such as <code>.keys()</code>, <code>.values()</code>, <code>.into_keys()</code>, <code>.into_values()</code>, <code>.values_mut()</code>, and <code>.retain(|k, v| …)</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Breaking changes</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Serialization no longer produces leading <code>---\n</code> on the serialized output. You can prepend this yourself if your use case demands it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Serialization of enum variants is now based on YAML's <code>!Tag</code> syntax, rather than JSON-style singleton maps.</p>
</li>
</ul>

2267,Bump MSRV to 1.56.1,"This is what `hashbrown` did recently: https://github.com/rust-lang/hashbrown/pull/298

And it causes CI failures for us. Examples:
* https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/pull/2266
* https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/pull/2265

The path of least resistance for us is to also bump MSRV, so let's do that. 1.56.1 was released [9 months ago](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2021/11/01/Rust-1.56.1.html).

There were some discussion regarding the bump which is an interesting read, see https://github.com/rust-lang/hashbrown/issues/310.

<blockquote>
<h2>0.9.6</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fix tag not getting serialized in certain map values (<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/dtolnay/serde-yaml/issues/302"">#302</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h2>0.9.5</h2>
<ul>
<li>Implement <code>Display</code> trait for <code>serde_yaml::value::Tag</code> (<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/dtolnay/serde-yaml/issues/307"">#307</a>, thanks <a href=""https://github.com/masinc""><code>@​masinc</code></a>)</li>
</ul>
<h2>0.9.4</h2>
<ul>
<li>Add <code>serde_yaml::with::singleton_map</code> for serialization of enums as a 1-entry map (<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/dtolnay/serde-yaml/issues/300"">#300</a>)</li>
<li>Reject duplicate keys when deserializing <code>Mapping</code> or <code>Value</code> (<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/dtolnay/serde-yaml/issues/301"">#301</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h2>0.9.3</h2>
<ul>
<li>Add categories to crates.io metadata</li>
<li>Add keywords to crates.io metadata</li>
</ul>
<h2>0.9.2</h2>
<ul>
<li>Improve <code>Debug</code> representation of <code>serde_yaml::Error</code></li>
</ul>
<h2>0.9.1</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fix panic on some documents containing syntax error (<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/dtolnay/serde-yaml/issues/293"">#293</a>)</li>
<li>Improve error messages that used to contain duplicative line/column information (<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/dtolnay/serde-yaml/issues/294"">#294</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h2>0.9.0</h2>
<p><em>API documentation: <a href=""https://docs.rs/serde_yaml/0.9"">https://docs.rs/serde_yaml/0.9</a></em></p>
<h3>Highlights</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <code>serde_yaml::Value</code> enum gains a <code>Tagged</code> variant which represents the deserialization of YAML's <code>!Tag</code> syntax. Tagged scalars, sequences, and mappings are all supported.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An empty YAML input (or document containing only comments) will deserialize successfully to an empty map, empty sequence, or Serde struct as long as the struct has only optional fields. Previously this would error.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A new <code>.apply_merge()</code> method on <code>Value</code> implements YAML's <code>&lt;&lt;</code> merge key convention.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>Debug</code> representation of <code>serde_yaml::Value</code> has gotten vastly better (<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/dtolnay/serde-yaml/pull/287"">dtolnay/serde-yaml#287</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deserialization of borrowed strings now works.</p>
<pre lang=""rust""><code>#[derive(Deserialize, Debug)]
struct Struct&lt;'a&gt; {
    borrowed: &amp;'a str,
}
<p>let yaml = &quot;borrowed: 'kölcsönzött'\n&quot;;
let value: Struct = serde_yaml::from_str(yaml)?;
println!(&quot;{:#?}&quot;, value);
</code></pre></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Value</code>'s and <code>Mapping</code>'s methods <code>get</code> and <code>get_mut</code> have been generalized to support a &amp;str argument, as opposed to requiring you to allocate and construct a <code>Value::String</code> for indexing into another existing <code>Value</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Mapping</code> exposes more APIs that have become conventional on map data structures, such as <code>.keys()</code>, <code>.values()</code>, <code>.into_keys()</code>, <code>.into_values()</code>, <code>.values_mut()</code>, and <code>.retain(|k, v| …)</code>.</p>

2275,better fish completions,"Back in 2020, the command-line completions for bat that had been shipping with fish were removed in favour of the completions file that currently ships with bat (see discussion in #651). Unfortunately, the [deprecated fish completions](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/blob/ea8a2b2/share/completions/bat.fish) had some nifty features that weren't carried over. This PR restores those features and expands upon them.

Improvements vs. the current completions:

- Less verbose descriptions → better columned layout.
  - Notably, default options (e.g. `always`, `auto`) are indicated in the option-completion text, not the description of the option itself.
- Supports all documented options, including those for `bat cache`.
- Fully (!) supports completing `bat --map-syntax <glob pattern>:<language syntax>`.
- Supports multiple comma-separated arguments to `bat --style`.
- Regular output options (e.g. `--style`) won't be suggested if a previous option (e.g. `--help`) overrides regular output/behaviour.
- The `{{PROJECT_EXECUTABLE}}` placeholders have been place-held by the locally-scoped `$bat`, for ease of reading and editing.
  - The names of the support functions (e.g. `__bat_complete_map_syntax`) are no longer parameterized, but ""the other bat"" [doesn't include shell completions](https://packages.debian.org/sid/x32/bacula-console-qt/filelist) as far as I can tell, so there shouldn't be any collisions.

Please let me know if you have any questions!

2299,refactor: Migrate to clap 3,"This updates to clap v3 and resolves all deprecations as of right now.

I mostly relied on the tests.

Help output has two main changes that I noticed
- The sections are no ""Args"", ""Options"", ""Subcommands""
- The text for `--version` is slightly different

I was confused as to why external subcommand support was enabled but I left it.

Some potential further changes
- Preserve parsed values (like numbers) rather than using strings
- Switch lists of possible values to implementing or deriving the `ValueEnum` trait on enums
- Switching to the derive

2303,bat v0.22,"# Release checklist

## Version bump

- [x] Update version in `Cargo.toml`. Run `cargo build` to update `Cargo.lock`.
      Make sure to `git add` the `Cargo.lock` changes as well.
- [x] Find the current min. supported Rust version by running
      `grep '^\s*MIN_SUPPORTED_RUST_VERSION' .github/workflows/CICD.yml`.
- [x] Update the version and the min. supported Rust version in `README.md` and
      `doc/README-*.md`. Check with
      `git grep -i -e 'rust.*1\.' -e '1\..*rust' | grep README | grep -v tests/`.
- [x] Update `CHANGELOG.md`. Introduce a section for the new release.

## Update syntaxes and themes (build assets)

- [x] Install the latest master version (`cargo clean && cargo install --locked -f --path .`) and make
      sure that it is available on the `PATH` (`bat --version` should show the
      new version).
- [x] Run `assets/create.sh` and check in the binary asset files.

## Documentation

- [x] Review `-h`, `--help`, and the `man` page. All of these are shown in
      the output of the CI job called *Documentation*, so look there.
      The CI workflow corresponding to the tip of the master branch is a good place to look.

## Pre-release checks

- [x] Push all changes and wait for CI to succeed (before continuing with the
      next section).
- [x] Optional: manually test the new features and command-line options. To do
      this, install the latest `bat` version again (to include the new syntaxes
      and themes).
- [x] Run `cargo publish --dry-run` to make sure that it will
      succeed later (after creating the GitHub release).

## Release

- [x] Create a tag and push it: `git tag vX.Y.Z; git push origin tag vX.Y.Z`.
      This will trigger the deployment via GitHub Actions.
      REMINDER: If your `origin` is a fork, don't forget to push to e.g. `upstream` instead!
- [x] Go to https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/releases/new to create the new
      release. Select the new tag and also use it as the release title. For the
      release notes, copy the corresponding section from `CHANGELOG.md` and
      possibly add additional remarks for package maintainers.
      Publish the release.
- [x] Check if the binary deployment works (archives and Debian packages should
      appear when the CI run for the Git tag has finished).
- [x] Publish to crates.io by running `cargo publish` in a *clean* repository.
      The safest way to do this is to clone a fresh copy.

## Post-release

- [x] Prepare a new ""unreleased"" section at the top of `CHANGELOG.md`.
      Put this at the top:

```
# unreleased

## Features

## Bugfixes

## Other

## Syntaxes

## Themes

## `bat` as a library

- [ ] ~~Run `assets/create.sh` and check in the binary asset files.~~

## Documentation

- [ ] ~~Review `-h`, `--help`, and the `man` page. All of these are shown in~~
      ~~the output of the CI job called *Documentation*, so look there.~~
      ~~The CI workflow corresponding to the tip of the master branch is a good place to look.~~

## Pre-release checks

- [x] Push all changes and wait for CI to succeed (before continuing with the
      next section).
- [x] Optional: manually test the new features and command-line options. To do
      this, install the latest `bat` version again (to include the new syntaxes
      and themes).
- [x] Run `cargo publish --dry-run` to make sure that it will
      succeed later (after creating the GitHub release).

## Release

- [x] Create a tag and push it: `git tag vX.Y.Z; git push origin tag vX.Y.Z`.
      This will trigger the deployment via GitHub Actions.
      REMINDER: If your `origin` is a fork, don't forget to push to e.g. `upstream` instead!
- [x] Go to https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/releases/new to create the new
      release. Select the new tag and also use it as the release title. For the
      release notes, copy the corresponding section from `CHANGELOG.md` and
      possibly add additional remarks for package maintainers.
      Publish the release.
- [x] Check if the binary deployment works (archives and Debian packages should
      appear when the CI run for the Git tag has finished).
- [x] Publish to crates.io by running `cargo publish` in a *clean* repository.
      The safest way to do this is to clone a fresh copy.

## Post-release

- [x] Prepare a new ""unreleased"" section at the top of `CHANGELOG.md`.
      Put this at the top:

```
# unreleased

## Features

## Bugfixes

## Other

## Syntaxes

## Themes

## `bat` as a library

2381,"Allow some env vars to override config variables, but not command line arguments","Giving #1281 a go.

This PR allows certain environment variables to take precedence over config settings, while allowing them to be overridden by their respective command line flags.

It does this by formatting those variables as a vector of command line args, and then inserting them between the config variables and command line args in `App::matches()`. Parsing the env variables in that way allows some env variable-specific code in `App` to be removed as well.

Right now, the env variables I picked are `BAT_TABS`, `BAT_THEME`, `BAT_PAGER`, and `BAT_STYLE` as I think those make the most sense to replace. It is straightforward to add more if needed. Note that `BAT_PAGER` takes precedence over config variables, but `PAGER` does not.

Also adds tests for the `cache` subcommand to make sure the changes don't break it (e.g. by inserting flags before `cache`).

2430,Require changes to `-h` and `--help` to be blessed,"From now on (if this PR is merged), any changes to the help texts will be visible in PR diffs, which will make it very easy to review, and very hard to accidentally miss changes to help texts.

If a contributor makes a change to help texts, the `cargo test` failure text they will see contains instructions on how to update the blessed help texts:

    error: expect test failed
       --> ../doc/long-help.txt

    You can update all `expect!` tests by running:

        env UPDATE_EXPECT=1 cargo test

In short, to update blessed help texts, one simply does

    UPDATE_EXPECT=1 cargo test

Do not run the tests if the `git` feature is missing, since then `--diff` will be missing from `--help`. And do not run the tests on Windows, because then the help text will contain the term `.exe`.

Move `man` page step to after `cargo doc` step in CI so that the man page exists when we look for it.

(The [`expect-test`](https://crates.io/crates/expect-test) crate is maintained under the `rust-analyzer` organization, and I've been using it and this help text setup in `cargo-public-api` for a while, and it has worked great so far.)

2442,Directly read macOS theme preference instead of using defaults,"Follows on https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/pull/2197 by improving the implementation of `macos_dark_mode_active`.

For reference there are a lot of ways to read preferences on macOS. Here's the 4 I know of:
1. `defaults` CLI
2. NSUserDefaults via Objective-C
3. CFPreferences via CoreFoundation (C/C++)
4. Directly reading and parsing the file from disk

Out of all of these, `defaults` is the slowest because it involves spawning and executing a whole separate executable to read one value. `defaults` is implemented via 2, which is implemented via 3 at the end. In order to speed this up, I just used option 4 as `bat`'s needs are fairly simple. Using `CFPreferences` would have also worked but the use of `#![deny(unsafe_code)]` indicated that would have been in conflict with the crate's goals since calling C APIs requires `unsafe` by nature. 

If `bat` wanted to do this 100% as-intended by Apple, and possibly take advantage of any OS-level caching, `CFPreferences.framework` would be the way. If you're good with the `unsafe` required, happy to swap out the implementation. Though I don't ever really expect the file reading method to break.

So this new implementation reads the hardcoded settings path and directly parses the plist data with the `plist` crate (already in the dependency tree from another crate, which was nice). As a result, in a release build, reading the theme is now 12x faster and pretty much imperceptible. The lowest time I saw with the old implementation was 4-5ms, while a release build call to `macos_dark_mode_active` now takes <500us on an M1 Max MacBook.",62,1604,2023-01-05 20:27:08+00:00,2023-02-05 15:53:28+00:00,2023-05-09 05:09:43+00:00,2023-02-05 15:53:28+00:00,closed,True,16,1,21,5,4,21,5,0,0,4,4,1,4,4,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,sharkdp/bat
2443,Print non-printable characters using caret notation,"Implements feature request #2429.

When using `--show-all`, non-printable characters are printed using the Unicode Control Pictures. This pr adds the flag `--caret-notation`, which can only be used together with `--show-all`. When `--caret-notation` is set, non-printable characters are printed using caret notation instead.


For example, without `--caret-notation`:
```
This·is·an·example·text.␊␍
```
With `--caret-notation`:
```
This·is·an·example·text.^J^M

2447,Remove unnecessary heap allocations in `PrettyPrinter::print` for style components,"Current `PrettyPrinter::print` implementation causes two redundant heap allocations for building style components.

- At first it collects all style components in `Vec` then it converts `Vec` into `HashSet`
- `HashSet` instance is re-created per `print` call

However both heap allocations are unnecessary because

- the `Vec` instance is not necessary if inserting components to `HashSet` directly
- the heap-allocated memory in `HashSet` instance can be reused",82,470,2023-01-15 10:16:23+00:00,2023-01-17 14:26:18+00:00,2023-01-17 14:26:22+00:00,2023-01-17 14:26:18+00:00,closed,True,1,1,21,12,2,21,12,0,0,2,2,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,sharkdp/bat

2444,Add `$LESSOPEN` and `$LESSCLOSE` support,"Addresses #1739 and offers an alternative to #1597.

This pull request adds support for `$LESSOPEN` and `$LESSCLOSE` to `bat`. I tried to be as compatible with `less`'s implementation as I could, and I tried to make sure it could handle each of the cases outlined in the ""Input Preprocessor' section of `less`'s `man` page. These cases are:

- `$LESSOPEN` writing output to a temporary file that gets cleaned up by `$LESSCLOSE`
- `$LESSOPEN` directly piping data and using empty output to signal to fall back to the original file
- `$LESSOPEN` directly piping data and using the exit code to determine whether or not to fall back to the original file
- The previous two cases, but also with `$LESSCLOSE`
- All of the above cases, but reading from stdin instead of a file

Basically, the `$LESSOPEN` preprocessor is used to create an `OpenedInput`, falling back to the default file opening method if unable to preprocess the file. A type called `Preprocessed`, which implements `BufRead`, is used to wrap either a temporary file or data directly output by `$LESSOPEN` and used to create an `InputReader`. When `$LESSCLOSE` is set, it is executed when the `Preprocessed` is dropped.

Rather than just using `std::process::Command`, I used a crate called [`run_script`](https://docs.rs/run_script/latest/run_script/), which runs shell commands in the shell rather than running a program and passing arguments directly, so that users can use things like input and output redirection directly like with less.

I also added a `--no-lessopen` flag similar to what `less` has, although I obviously could not add the corresponding `-L` flag since it is already in use. I updated the completion scripts where applicable.

In addition, I made sure to be as thorough as I reasonably could with the regression tests. However, I disabled the integration tests on Windows and other non-Unix-like systems with `#[cfg(unix)]` because they were not written with Windows in mind. Is this something that I should try to fix first?

I referenced #1597 to help me figure out an approach, although my implementation is still rather different and does not use any `unsafe` code.",40,2172,2023-01-11 21:25:07+00:00,2023-09-02 06:48:26+00:00,2023-12-16 18:21:27+00:00,2023-09-02 06:48:26+00:00,closed,True,14,5,748,4,16,748,4,1,0,15,15,6,5,5,0,0,0,0,16,0,0,sharkdp/bat

2514,Updates for bat 0.23,"# Release checklist

## Version bump

- [x] Update version in `Cargo.toml`. Run `cargo build` to update `Cargo.lock`.
      Make sure to `git add` the `Cargo.lock` changes as well.
- [x] Find the current min. supported Rust version by running
      `cargo metadata --no-deps --format-version 1 | jq -r '.packages[0].rust_version'`.
- [x] Update the version and the min. supported Rust version in `README.md` and
      `doc/README-*.md`. Check with
      `git grep -i -e 'rust.*1\.' -e '1\..*rust' | grep README | grep -v tests/`.
- [x] Update `CHANGELOG.md`. Introduce a section for the new release.

## Update syntaxes and themes (build assets)

- [x] Install the latest master version (`cargo clean && cargo install --locked -f --path .`) and make
      sure that it is available on the `PATH` (`bat --version` should show the
      new version).
- [x] Run `assets/create.sh` and check in the binary asset files.

## Documentation

- [x] Review [`-h`](./short-help.txt), [`--help`](./long-help.txt), and the `man` page. The `man` page is shown in
      the output of the CI job called *Documentation*, so look there.
      The CI workflow corresponding to the tip of the master branch is a good place to look.

## Pre-release checks

- [x] Push all changes and wait for CI to succeed (before continuing with the
      next section).
- [x] Optional: manually test the new features and command-line options. To do
      this, install the latest `bat` version again (to include the new syntaxes
      and themes).
- [x] Run `cargo publish --dry-run` to make sure that it will
      succeed later (after creating the GitHub release).

## Release

- [x] Create a tag and push it: `git tag vX.Y.Z; git push origin tag vX.Y.Z`.
      This will trigger the deployment via GitHub Actions.
      REMINDER: If your `origin` is a fork, don't forget to push to e.g. `upstream` instead!
- [x] Go to https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/releases/new to create the new
      release. Select the new tag and also use it as the release title. For the
      release notes, copy the corresponding section from `CHANGELOG.md` and
      possibly add additional remarks for package maintainers.
      Publish the release.
- [x] Check if the binary deployment works (archives and Debian packages should
      appear when the CI run for the Git tag has finished).
- [x] Publish to crates.io by running `cargo publish` in a *clean* repository.
      The safest way to do this is to clone a fresh copy.

## Post-release

- [x] Prepare a new ""unreleased"" section at the top of `CHANGELOG.md`.
      Put this at the top:

```
# unreleased

## Features

## Bugfixes

## Other

## Syntaxes

## Themes

## `bat` as a library

<details>
<summary>Changelog</summary>
<p><em>Sourced from <a href=""https://github.com/Stebalien/tempfile/blob/master/NEWS"">tempfile's changelog</a>.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<h1>3.5.0</h1>
<ul>
<li>Update rustix from 0.36 to 0.37.1. This makes wasi work on rust stable</li>
<li>Update <code>windows-sys</code>, <code>redox_syscall</code></li>
<li>BREAKING: Remove the implementation of <code>Write for &amp;NamedTempFile&lt;F&gt; where &amp;F: Write</code>. Unfortunately, this can cause compile issues in unrelated code (<a href=""https://redirect.github.com/Stebalien/tempfile/issues/224"">Stebalien/tempfile#224</a>).</li>
</ul>
<h1>3.4.0</h1>
<p>SECURITY: Prior <code>tempfile</code> releases depended on <code>remove_dir_all</code> version 0.5.0 which was vulnerable to a <a href=""https://github.com/XAMPPRocky/remove_dir_all/security/advisories/GHSA-mc8h-8q98-g5hr"">TOCTOU race</a>. This same race is present in rust versions prior to 1.58.1.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Generalized temporary files: <code>NamedTempFile</code> can now abstract over different kinds of files (e.g.,
unix domain sockets, pipes, etc.):
<ul>
<li>Add <code>Builder::make</code> and <code>Builder::make_in</code> for generalized temp file
creation.</li>
<li>Add <code>NamedTempFile::from_parts</code> to complement <code>NamedTempFile::into_parts</code>.</li>
<li>Add generic parameter to <code>NamedTempFile</code> to support wrapping non-File types.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Bug Fixes/Improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don't try to create a temporary file multiple times if the file path has been fully specified by
the user (no random characters).</li>
<li><code>NamedTempFile::persist_noclobber</code> is now always atomic on linux when <code>renameat_with</code> is
supported. Previously, it would first link the new path, then unlink the previous path.</li>
<li>Fix compiler warnings on windows.</li>
</ul>
<p>Trivia:</p>
<ul>
<li>Switch from <code>libc</code> to <code>rustix</code> on wasi/unix. This now makes direct syscalls instead of calling
through libc.</li>
<li>Remove <code>remove_dir_all</code> dependency. The rust standard library has optimized their internal version
significantly.</li>
<li>Switch to official windows-sys windows bindings.</li>
</ul>
<p>Breaking:</p>
<ul>
<li>The minimum rust version is now <code>1.48.0</code>.</li>
<li>Mark most functions as <code>must_use</code>.</li>
<li>Uses direct syscalls on linux by default, instead of libc.</li>
<li>The new type parameter in <code>NamedTempFile</code> may lead to type inference issues in some cases.</li>

./target/debug/bat /nix/store/sm8lcsj94pqsb43ssb7cx3r424zs71p1-nginx.conf

This is a very typical nix store autogenerated NixOS nginx config naming scheme.

```console
./target/debug/bat -L
[ ... ]
nginx                     conf.erb, nginx.conf, mime.types, fastcgi_params, scgi_params, uwsgi_params, /etc/nginx/**/*.conf,
                          /etc/nginx/sites-*/**/*, **nginx.conf
```

This means the removal of `mime.types` and `nginx.conf` has been merely a deduplication.

2544,Treat OSC ANSI Sequences as Invisible Text & Add OSC 8 Support,"Fixes #2541 by ~~removing OSC sequences from lines before starting to print them.~~ no longer considering ANSI OSC sequences as visible text.

|<img width=""1278"" alt=""image"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32112321/232371560-eaa6389a-2ae4-434e-9e90-3f9e8fdf6a72.png"">|
|:-:|
|(Left: Fixed, Right: Current version)|

Prior to this change, we don't interpret OSC sequences in any special way. They aren't caught by `console::AnsiCodeIterator`, so the OSC sequences were being treated as visible text.

- When the OSC is printed in full, the terminal would see a valid sequence and hide it. As a consequence, lines would b e wrapped too early.

- When the OSC is broken for line wrapping, the terminal wouldn't see a valid sequence. In this case, it prints both halves of the text on different lines and appears to be junk.

---

**Edit:** I had some extra time. A couple of new commits gave special handling for the OSC 8 sequence, allowing bat to disable the hyperlink at the end of the line and then re-emit it at the start of the next line.

<details>
<summary>Changelog</summary>
<p><em>Sourced from <a href=""https://github.com/rust-lang/regex/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md"">regex's changelog</a>.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<h1>1.8.1 (2023-04-21)</h1>
<p>This is a patch release that fixes a bug where a regex match could be reported
where none was found. Specifically, the bug occurs when a pattern contains some
literal prefixes that could be extracted <em>and</em> an optional word boundary in the
prefix.</p>
<p>Bug fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>[BUG <a href=""https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/981"">#981</a>](<a href=""https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/981"">rust-lang/regex#981</a>):
Fix a bug where a word boundary could interact with prefix literal
optimizations and lead to a false positive match.</li>
</ul>
<h1>1.8.0 (2023-04-20)</h1>
<p>This is a sizeable release that will be soon followed by another sizeable
release. Both of them will combined close over 40 existing issues and PRs.</p>
<p>This first release, despite its size, essentially represents preparatory work
for the second release, which will be even bigger. Namely, this release:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increases the MSRV to Rust 1.60.0, which was released about 1 year ago.</li>
<li>Upgrades its dependency on <code>aho-corasick</code> to the recently released 1.0
version.</li>
<li>Upgrades its dependency on <code>regex-syntax</code> to the simultaneously released
<code>0.7</code> version. The changes to <code>regex-syntax</code> principally revolve around a
rewrite of its literal extraction code and a number of simplifications and
optimizations to its high-level intermediate representation (HIR).</li>
</ul>
<p>The second release, which will follow ~shortly after the release above, will
contain a soup-to-nuts rewrite of every regex engine. This will be done by
bringing <a href=""https://github.com/BurntSushi/regex-automata""><code>regex-automata</code></a> into
this repository, and then changing the <code>regex</code> crate to be nothing but an API
shim layer on top of <code>regex-automata</code>'s API.</p>
<p>These tandem releases are the culmination of about 3
years of on-and-off work that <a href=""https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/656"">began in earnest in March
2020</a>.</p>
<p>Because of the scale of changes involved in these releases, I would love to
hear about your experience. Especially if you notice undocumented changes in
behavior or performance changes (positive <em>or</em> negative).</p>
<p>Most changes in the first release are listed below. For more details, please
see the commit log, which reflects a linear and decently documented history
of all changes.</p>
<p>New features:</p>

2569,CICD: Run cargo audit,"This CI check will fail if there are crates with known security vulnerabilities in Cargo.lock.

It will not fail because of warnings. We currently have two warnings:

```

Note that `cargo-audit` is installed by default on GitHub's Ubuntu runners.

I've run this in my own projects for quite some time, and it works well in my experience.

If we run into a dep that has a vulnerability but no known fix, we can temporarily disable this check again. But it is good practice to run cargo-audit when possible.

2574,Fix paging not happening when stdout is interactive but stdin is not,"This seems to have been introduced in 57cc0d843567eef566540074b391f8212d859871 since the condition `!atty::is(Stream::Stdin)` was inverted to `std::io::stdin().is_terminal()`. This seems to be a mistake since the comment says
```
// If we are reading from stdin, only enable paging if we write to an
// interactive terminal and if we do not *read* from an interactive
// terminal.
```
but the current code enables paging if stdin **is interactive**. 

This PR just flips the condition back to how it was to restore the original behavior. 
No changelog update as there hasn't been a release since the regression was introduced.

2580,Enable `bat` to find `more` binary on Windows,"On Windows, `more` is a COM executable (i.e. its extension is `com`). As `resolve_binary()` tries to emulate the behaviour of Win32 API's `CreateProcess()`, it will search for `more.exe` and fail. This commit adds an exception to that by specifying the pager's binary explicitly.

Fixes #2570. See also BurntSushi/ripgrep#2523.

I'd like to add that `more` is not as bad as README makes it to be - it *does* support colors:

<blockquote>
<h1>1.8.3 (2023-05-25)</h1>
<p>This is a patch release that fixes a bug where the regex would report a
match at every position even when it shouldn't. This could occur in a very
small subset of regexes, usually an alternation of simple literals that
have particular properties. (See the issue linked below for a more precise
description.)</p>
<p>Bug fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>[BUG <a href=""https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/999"">#999</a>](<a href=""https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/999"">rust-lang/regex#999</a>):
Fix a bug where a match at every position is erroneously reported.</li>
</ul>
<h1>1.8.2 (2023-05-22)</h1>
<p>This is a patch release that fixes a bug where regex compilation could panic
in debug mode for regexes with large counted repetitions. For example,
<code>a{2147483516}{2147483416}{5}</code> resulted in an integer overflow that wrapped
in release mode but panicking in debug mode. Despite the unintended wrapping
arithmetic in release mode, it didn't cause any other logical bugs since the
errant code was for new analysis that wasn't used yet.</p>
<p>Bug fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>[BUG <a href=""https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/995"">#995</a>](<a href=""https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/995"">rust-lang/regex#995</a>):

2588,CICD: Add `all-jobs` job,"This opens up future possibilities:
* GitHub's auto-merge feature that merges a PR once CI passes
* Auto-merge of dependabot PRs that pass CI ([example](https://github.com/Enselic/cargo-public-api/pull/425))

But before we do any of that we need to have this new job merged for a while to see that it works also in bat's CI setup. In other words, we need to check that it only pass if all other jobs pass, and fails otherwise.

Behavior when input is directory and existed

Master branch: `call_pager` is `true` because it only checks whether the path exists or not.

<details>
<summary>Release notes</summary>
<p><em>Sourced from <a href=""https://github.com/nushell/nu-ansi-term/releases"">nu-ansi-term's releases</a>.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<h2>v0.48.0</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Warning</strong>
This release introduces an unintended breaking change for users that want to construct <code>Style</code> directly. (see <a href=""https://redirect.github.com/nushell/nu-ansi-term/issues/46"">#46</a> for tracking)</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>New features</h2>
<p>This release <a href=""https://redirect.github.com/nushell/nu-ansi-term/pull/43"">introduces support</a> to express several OSC control codes by calling methods on <code>AnsiGenericString</code>. Primarily you can now mark particular text with a hyperlink by calling <code>.hyperlink()</code> on it.</p>
<pre lang=""rust""><code>use nu_ansi_term::AnsiString;
<p>let link_string = AnsiString::from(&quot;Learn more about this crate!&quot;).hyperlink(&quot;<a href=""https://docs.rs/nu-ansi-term"">https://docs.rs/nu-ansi-term</a>&quot;);
</code></pre></p>
<h3>Additional OSC codes:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong>
If these features are usable depends on the terminal emulator.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><code>AnsiString::title()</code> to set the title bar of the terminal emulator.</li>
<li><code>AnsiString::cwd()</code> to inform the terminal about changes to the working directory.</li>
<li><code>AnsiString::icon()</code> to supply an icon that the terminal may use for the application.</li>
</ul>
<h3>GNU legacy compatible output</h3>
<p>The new crate feature <code>gnu_legacy</code> will output CSI sequences which include leading zeros <a href=""https://redirect.github.com/nushell/nu-ansi-term/pull/39"">to be compatible with the GNU coreutils test suite</a></p>
<h3>Ability to force a reset of the style</h3>
<p><code>nu-ansi-term</code> strives to only output the ANSI sequences necessary to express the desired style. In some situation it may be beneficial to force the terminal emulator to reset its internal style before applying a new style.
To do so you can now use <a href=""https://redirect.github.com/nushell/nu-ansi-term/pull/40""><code>Style.reset_before_style()</code></a>.</p>
<h2>Other changes</h2>
<ul>
<li>We now depend on <code>windows-sys</code> 0.48 (<a href=""https://github.com/nickelc""><code>@​nickelc</code></a> in <a href=""https://redirect.github.com/nushell/nu-ansi-term/pull/38"">nushell/nu-ansi-term#38</a>)</li>

2618,feat: Optionally write to a buffer instead of stdout,"Following on from my comment in #956, this PR adds the ability to write output to a `std::fmt` buffer instead of stdout. It does this by changing the `handle` used by the printer to be a mutable reference to either one of `dyn fmt::Write` or `dyn io::Write`.

Included is also an added example to show that it works. I didn't add it to the `PrettyPrinter` but I can do if it seems like a good idea.

Anything else let me know!",52,430,2023-07-09 00:55:23+00:00,2023-09-01 19:18:04+00:00,2023-09-01 19:20:55+00:00,2023-09-01 19:18:04+00:00,closed,True,4,6,141,55,6,141,55,1,0,5,5,3,1,1,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,sharkdp/bat

2626,Replace unmaintained `encoding` dependency with `encoding_rs`,"bat depends on `encoding` crate but it is [no longer maintained](https://github.com/lifthrasiir/rust-encoding/issues/127). This is reported as [RUSTSEC-2021-0153](https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2021-0153) in the advisory DB. The advisory suggests [`encoding_rs` crate](https://crates.io/crates/encoding_rs) as alternative.

This PR replaces the unmaintained crate with the alternative.

As a side effect, this patch makes bat's UTF16 support a bit more efficient:

- Decoding with UTF16LE or UTF16BE is now handled with `Cow` instead of `String`. It means that it can avoid extra allocation by reusing the original string buffer when no character in the buffer was replaced while encoding.
- Removing BOM is now handled by `encoding_rs` more efficiently thanks to [`encode_with_bom_removal`](https://docs.rs/encoding_rs/latest/encoding_rs/struct.Encoding.html#method.decode_with_bom_removal) methods. The previous implementation always allocated new buffer only for removing BOM.",61,994,2023-07-21 14:48:40+00:00,2023-09-01 19:12:07+00:00,2023-09-01 19:12:07+00:00,2023-09-01 19:12:07+00:00,closed,True,0,1,21,79,3,21,79,0,0,3,3,1,3,3,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,sharkdp/bat
2631,Try to detect the current theme based on the terminal background color,"This uses the termbg crate, as discussed here: https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/issues/1746
Other than that, it uses the same logic as on macOS.

This behavior should probably be extended to macOS too, for cases like a terminal with a light background while the system theme is dark (or vice versa). But I didn't want to accidentally break anything on macOS.

<blockquote>
<h2>v0.49.0</h2>
<p>This release attempts to fix API limitations of the previous <code>0.48.0</code> release.
You can now again construct <code>Style</code> directly through its fields.</p>
<h2>Breaking changes</h2>
<h3>coming from <code>0.47.0</code></h3>
<ul>
<li>Style has now a <code>prefix_with_reset</code> field to enable additional reset sequences that are introduced before setting a style.</li>
</ul>
<h3>coming from <code>0.48.0</code></h3>
<ul>
<li><code>Style.with_reset</code> has been renamed to <code>Style.prefix_with_reset</code></li>
<li><code>AnsiGenericString::hyperlink()</code> changed in signature from <code>...(&amp;mut self, ...)</code> to <code>...(self, ...) -&gt; Self</code></li>
<li><code>AnsiGenericString::icon()</code> and <code>::cwd()</code> have been removed for now.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What's Changed</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fix Re-enabling manual Style creation by <a href=""https://github.com/mhelsley""><code>@​mhelsley</code></a> in <a href=""https://redirect.github.com/nushell/nu-ansi-term/pull/47"">nushell/nu-ansi-term#47</a></li>
<li>Use chaining for <code>AnsiGenericString::hyperlink</code> by <a href=""https://github.com/sholderbach""><code>@​sholderbach</code></a> in <a href=""https://redirect.github.com/nushell/nu-ansi-term/pull/48"">nushell/nu-ansi-term#48</a></li>
<li>Make <code>Style.with_reset</code> more explicit as <code>prefix_with_reset</code> by <a href=""https://github.com/sholderbach""><code>@​sholderbach</code></a> in <a href=""https://redirect.github.com/nushell/nu-ansi-term/pull/50"">nushell/nu-ansi-term#50</a></li>
<li>Bump version for 0.49 release by <a href=""https://github.com/sholderbach""><code>@​sholderbach</code></a> in <a href=""https://redirect.github.com/nushell/nu-ansi-term/pull/49"">nushell/nu-ansi-term#49</a></li>

<p><strong>Full Changelog</strong>: <a href=""https://github.com/nushell/nu-ansi-term/compare/v0.48.0...v0.49.0"">https://github.com/nushell/nu-ansi-term/compare/v0.48.0...v0.49.0</a></p>
<h2>v0.48.0</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Warning</strong>
This release introduces an unintended breaking change for users that want to construct <code>Style</code> directly. (see <a href=""https://redirect.github.com/nushell/nu-ansi-term/issues/46"">#46</a> for tracking)</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>New features</h2>
<p>This release <a href=""https://redirect.github.com/nushell/nu-ansi-term/pull/43"">introduces support</a> to express several OSC control codes by calling methods on <code>AnsiGenericString</code>. Primarily you can now mark particular text with a hyperlink by calling <code>.hyperlink()</code> on it.</p>
<pre lang=""rust""><code>use nu_ansi_term::AnsiString;
<p>let link_string = AnsiString::from(&quot;Learn more about this crate!&quot;).hyperlink(&quot;<a href=""https://docs.rs/nu-ansi-term"">https://docs.rs/nu-ansi-term</a>&quot;);
</code></pre></p>
<h3>Additional OSC codes:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong>
If these features are usable depends on the terminal emulator.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><code>AnsiString::title()</code> to set the title bar of the terminal emulator.</li>
<li><code>AnsiString::cwd()</code> to inform the terminal about changes to the working directory.</li>
<li><code>AnsiString::icon()</code> to supply an icon that the terminal may use for the application.</li>
</ul>
<h3>GNU legacy compatible output</h3>
<p>The new crate feature <code>gnu_legacy</code> will output CSI sequences which include leading zeros <a href=""https://redirect.github.com/nushell/nu-ansi-term/pull/39"">to be compatible with the GNU coreutils test suite</a></p>
<h3>Ability to force a reset of the style</h3>
<p><code>nu-ansi-term</code> strives to only output the ANSI sequences necessary to express the desired style. In some situation it may be beneficial to force the terminal emulator to reset its internal style before applying a new style.
To do so you can now use <a href=""https://redirect.github.com/nushell/nu-ansi-term/pull/40""><code>Style.reset_before_style()</code></a>.</p>

2662,Fix `$LESSOPEN` tests and behavior,"This PR has a handful of fixes for the `$LESSOPEN` functionality that addresses concerns brought up in #2444 and #2602:

- Pass `--no-lessopen` to `less` to prevent it from preprocessing input a second file. ~~This should fix the intermittently failing test, assuming we correctly figured out the cause.~~ **Unfortunately, this did not appear to fix the intermittently failing test.**
- Make `$LESSOPEN` support opt-in rather than on by default. I added a `--lessopen` flag to enable this and kept the `--no-lessopen` flag for people that add `--lessopen` to their config file, but want to override it for whatever reason. Also changed the tests, man page, and completions accordingly.
- Require that `$LESSOPEN` has exactly one `%s`, otherwise ignoring it and with a warning message much like `less` does. Also changed the tests accordingly.
- Along with updating CHANGELOG.md, I took the liberty of moving the entry for the `$LESSOPEN` PR from v0.22.0 to the unreleased features section since it wasn't updated before it was merged recently.
- ~~I re-added the `lessopen` feature to `default` since you need to enable it with an option now anyways. I made sure to have this in its own commit so it can be easily removed if anyone objects to it.~~ Per @Enselic's [request](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/pull/2662#discussion_r1318883698), I removed it so it has a chance to get more testing before being enabled by default.",34,1430,2023-09-06 20:00:28+00:00,2023-09-08 04:25:21+00:00,2023-09-09 00:22:06+00:00,2023-09-08 04:25:21+00:00,closed,True,13,5,146,31,11,146,31,0,0,11,11,5,3,3,0,0,0,0,11,0,0,sharkdp/bat

2689,fix for issue #2675: search feature should not search on line numbers  and headers ,"It fixes #2675

Currently, `less` will perform the search on all the content that is written on its STDIN. To make it ignore the headers and the line numbers, `less`, from version 600, has added 2 new options:
- `--header` to set the headers (filename, file size, and panel text)
- `--no-search-headers` to ignore those headers.

So, I will use those 2 options to make the search work correctly.

Btw, as I said above, this fix is only applicable for `less` version from 600 and above because those options only existed from that version.",83,546,2023-10-01 13:28:18+00:00,,2025-08-22 15:27:05+00:00,2025-08-22 15:27:04+00:00,closed,False,5,1,108,28,4,108,28,0,0,4,4,1,2,2,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,sharkdp/bat

Since syntax tests use `default` theme, bat automatically switches the default color theme looking at the OS settings on macOS. However syntax tests assume the theme is always dark. So the tests fail during the daytime in my environment.

2711,Setup auto-merge of dependabot PRs that pass CI,"I have been using this myself in cargo-public-api, and what we have here is the result of several iterations, and this has worked well for quite some time now.

To activate this, we need to:
* Go to https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/settings/branches (only you can do this sharkdp)
  * Click 'Edit' for 'master'
  * Check 'Require status checks to pass before merging'
  * Check 'Require branches to be up to date before merging'
  * For 'Status checks that are required.', add 'all-jobs'
* Create a token for a bot-user. We can use @EnselicCICD, or maybe you sharkdp can create your own account. GitHub ToS explicitly allows one machine-account per user last time I checked.
* Add that user as a collaborator to this repo (only you can do this sharkdp).

Maintainers will still be able to push directly to main.

### Require branches to be up to date before merging

If we don't enable this, we will get problems with dependabot PRs that individually pass CI, but combined do not. dependabot will auto-rebase its PRs so until all PRs are merged (or CI fails).

### What about merge of pointless dependabot bumps?

Sometimes dependabot bumps the version of a git repo that conatins a syntax, but the bump does not change .sublime-syntax. I think we can live with this. It's not a big deal by my estimation.

### What about CHANGELOG.md?

Before a release we need we can let GitHub generate release notes from a draft release, and then we can check what dependabot has bumped in terms of syntaxes and themes, and add that to CHANGELOG.md. I should update release-checklist.md later.

I'm sure there are details I've missed, but this is a start to set this up.

<blockquote>
<h1>1.9.4 (2023-08-26)</h1>
<p>This is a patch release that fixes a bug where <code>RegexSet::is_match(..)</code> could
incorrectly return false (even when <code>RegexSet::matches(..).matched_any()</code>
returns true).</p>
<p>Bug fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>[BUG <a href=""https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/1070"">#1070</a>](<a href=""https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/1070"">rust-lang/regex#1070</a>):
Fix a bug where a prefilter was incorrectly configured for a <code>RegexSet</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h1>1.9.3 (2023-08-05)</h1>
<p>This is a patch release that fixes a bug where some searches could result in
incorrect match offsets being reported. It is difficult to characterize the
types of regexes susceptible to this bug. They generally involve patterns
that contain no prefix or suffix literals, but have an inner literal along with
a regex prefix that can conditionally match.</p>
<p>Bug fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>[BUG <a href=""https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/1060"">#1060</a>](<a href=""https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/1060"">rust-lang/regex#1060</a>):
Fix a bug with the reverse inner literal optimization reporting incorrect match
offsets.</li>
</ul>
<h1>1.9.2 (2023-08-05)</h1>
<p>This is a patch release that fixes another memory usage regression. This
particular regression occurred only when using a <code>RegexSet</code>. In some cases,
much more heap memory (by one or two orders of magnitude) was allocated than in
versions prior to 1.9.0.</p>
<p>Bug fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>[BUG <a href=""https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/1059"">#1059</a>](<a href=""https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/1059"">rust-lang/regex#1059</a>):
Fix a memory usage regression when using a <code>RegexSet</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h1>1.9.1 (2023-07-07)</h1>
<p>This is a patch release which fixes a memory usage regression. In the regex
1.9 release, one of the internal engines used a more aggressive allocation
strategy than what was done previously. This patch release reverts to the
prior on-demand strategy.</p>
<p>Bug fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>[BUG <a href=""https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/1027"">#1027</a>](<a href=""https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/1027"">rust-lang/regex#1027</a>):</li>

<h1>1.10.2 (2023-10-16)</h1>
<p>This is a new patch release that fixes a search regression where incorrect
matches could be reported.</p>
<p>Bug fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>[BUG <a href=""https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/1110"">#1110</a>](<a href=""https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/1110"">rust-lang/regex#1110</a>):
Revert broadening of reverse suffix literal optimization introduced in 1.10.1.</li>
</ul>
<h1>1.10.1 (2023-10-14)</h1>
<p>This is a new patch release with a minor increase in the number of valid
patterns and a broadening of some literal optimizations.</p>
<p>New features:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=""https://github.com/rust-lang/regex/commit/04f5d7be4efc542864cc400f5d43fbea4eb9bab6"">FEATURE 04f5d7be</a>:
Loosen ASCII-compatible rules such that regexes like <code>(?-u:☃)</code> are now allowed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Performance improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=""https://github.com/rust-lang/regex/commit/8a8d599f9d2f2d78e9ad84e4084788c2d563afa5"">PERF 8a8d599f</a>:
Broader the reverse suffix optimization to apply in more cases.</li>
</ul>
<h1>1.10.0 (2023-10-09)</h1>
<p>This is a new minor release of <code>regex</code> that adds support for start and end
word boundary assertions. That is, <code>\&lt;</code> and <code>\&gt;</code>. The minimum supported Rust
version has also been raised to 1.65, which was released about one year ago.</p>
<p>The new word boundary assertions are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>\&lt;</code> or <code>\b{start}</code>: a Unicode start-of-word boundary (<code>\W|\A</code> on the left,
<code>\w</code> on the right).</li>
<li><code>\&gt;</code> or <code>\b{end}</code>: a Unicode end-of-word boundary (<code>\w</code> on the left, <code>\W|\z</code>
on the right)).</li>
<li><code>\b{start-half}</code>: half of a Unicode start-of-word boundary (<code>\W|\A</code> on the
left).</li>
<li><code>\b{end-half}</code>: half of a Unicode end-of-word boundary (<code>\W|\z</code> on the
right).</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>\&lt;</code> and <code>\&gt;</code> are GNU extensions to POSIX regexes. They have been added
to the <code>regex</code> crate because they enjoy somewhat broad support in other regex
engines as well (for example, vim). The <code>\b{start}</code> and <code>\b{end}</code> assertions
are aliases for <code>\&lt;</code> and <code>\&gt;</code>, respectively.</p>
<p>The <code>\b{start-half}</code> and <code>\b{end-half}</code> assertions are not found in any</p>

2756,Build script refactor,"The original intent behind this PR is to accommodate for #2747 (PR: #2755), which requires significant code additional to the build script. Hence it would make sense to clean up the build script beforehand and make it organizationally amenable to said addition (i.e. splitting the code into multiple files and modules). There should be no functional changes.

While doing so, I also did some maintenance work:
- cleaned out the old compgen code that's unlikely to ever be used again
- use `anyhow` to make life a bit easier
- fix inaccurate use of the `option_env!` and `env!` macros (the environment variables should be read at build script run time, not build script compile time)
- use newer code style, specifically
  - implicit variable capture in format string ([since 1.58.0](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2022/01/13/Rust-1.58.0.html#captured-identifiers-in-format-strings))
  - use `[].into_iter().collect()` to immutably construct a `HashMap` ([since 1.56.0 & 2021 edition](https://doc.rust-lang.org/edition-guide/rust-2021/IntoIterator-for-arrays.html))

The current behavior of `bat` is to check whether or not `NO_COLOR` is set, and even if it's an empty string, it still disables color.",53,394,2023-11-04 13:11:55+00:00,2023-12-02 11:43:55+00:00,2023-12-02 14:05:32+00:00,2023-12-02 11:43:55+00:00,closed,True,2,2,8,2,3,8,2,0,0,3,3,1,2,2,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,sharkdp/bat

2772,Improvements and fixes to zsh completion,"* Use correct return status so that approximate completion isn't broken. Zsh completions should not return 0 if they fail to add matches. Supporting this typically involves a local variable named `ret` as in the patch. Someone was complaining on a forum about this not working which is what motivated me to take a look 
* Follow zsh conventions on description forms. Not using capitalisation is the convention going back a long time and most people agree that consistency is more important than any preference one way or another. There was also some things which look like copy-paste from help output. We don't put types in angle brackets, e.g. <mode> - users can configure that if they like it and references to something like N only make sense in help output where N also appears in a syntax summary.
* Some options can be used multiple times, e.g. -H, -r, --file-name. That's the initial `*` in the spec.
* Set completion context correctly for the cache subcommand. This matters for configuration with `zstyle`.
* Better completion for --map-syntax argument
* Add --nonprintable-notation option. There's also -S/--chop-long-lines but I'm not sure whether these are deprecated forms of `--wrap`.
* Correct some of the mutual exclusion lists for options. Options don't need to exclude themselves - that's the default. And some options were excluding `:` instead of `*` which doesn't make sense with `_files` being called from a `*` spec - perhaps that was reflecting an old form the function took.

I also put in a fallback to complete ""cache"" if `_files` fails. I think this addresses the concerns from the old linked github issue while allowing `bat cac` to complete to 'cache' if there aren't already files. The normal zsh approach would actually be to use `_alternative` and allow the user to configure it.",40,1819,2023-11-12 13:58:09+00:00,2023-12-01 10:11:44+00:00,2023-12-01 10:11:44+00:00,2023-12-01 10:11:44+00:00,closed,True,1,2,64,52,2,64,52,0,0,2,2,1,2,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,sharkdp/bat

2780,Add context-around-highlight option,"The motivation behind this PR is mostly for my own convenience. 

I use ripgrep + fzf a lot in my workflow(where I use bat for previewing result). 

I have one function in my zshrc which looks like this:

![image](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/assets/38459660/10348cf7-b870-43fb-a67e-af7bb4c1483a)

So when I search for something using `ff nvim`, I get something like this:

![image](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/assets/38459660/79381335-32c3-4235-a5d6-a00f2cad22d1)

I was quite frustrated by this because I have context of what's happening after the matching line but not before. 
This could probably be done by using some very very hacky script but I just thought adding this feature to bat might be more easier.

I'm making this PR to solve that issue because it might be helpful to other folks too.

After this change and making some change to my zsh function, I get something like this for preview

An example of this can be seen by running:
```bash
cargo run -- --render-hex-colors tests/examples/hex_colors.txt
```

### Limitations

 - color values must be in the form of #rrggbb or #rgb (e.g. #f2a023 or #fa2)
 - only works on true-color terminals

2805,Rework `lessopen` implementation to use `execute` crate instead of `run_script`,"I replaced the `lessopen` implementation to use a crate called `execute` instead of the currently-used `run_script`. This has the benefit of simplifying the code a little, but more importantly fixes a few weird issues I noticed.

The issues I noticed that these changes fix are:

- [`batpipe`](https://github.com/eth-p/bat-extras/blob/master/doc/batpipe.md) not working right when using `fish` as a shell. Currently, `bat` shows the commands that `batpipe` prints to configure `$LESSOPEN` when you evaluate it in your startup config rather than the preprocessed file output.
- `bat` not showing any output at all when using [`glow`](https://github.com/charmbracelet/glow) to preprocess markdown files.

Edit: [Also appears to fix some known issues with `lessopen`-related integration tests.](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/pull/2805#issuecomment-2509550516)",79,864,2023-12-16 23:16:11+00:00,2025-01-06 04:21:46+00:00,2025-01-07 02:00:24+00:00,2025-01-06 04:21:46+00:00,closed,True,4,5,127,168,5,127,168,0,0,5,5,2,4,4,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,sharkdp/bat
2797,Try to detect the current theme based on the terminal background color,"This uses the termbg crate, as discussed here: https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/issues/1746
Other than that, it uses the same logic as on macOS.

This behavior should probably be extended to macOS too, for cases like a terminal with a light background while the system theme is dark (or vice versa). But I didn't want to accidentally break anything on macOS.

As mentioned in that thread, it is possible that this change brings about no performance improvements at all, hence ""exploratory"". However, it is likely that as the mapping rule list grows, the benefits of leveraging multiple threads will (eventually, if we ever get there) start to outweigh the cost of spawning them.

2839,Change CONTRIBUTING.md according to new changelog requirements,"In PR #2766 ([`bcc2de86`](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/commit/bcc2de86b47c26ad5393588aaead540e348dfc3c)) a new workflow was added which ensures that the `CHANGELOG` stays up to date and that entries follow a certain format. However, this has led to quite a bit of confusion among contributors (https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/pull/2827#issuecomment-1874709439). For example, the authors of #2827, #2807, #2835 and #2818 had to modify the changelog multiple times to match the requirements.

To solve that, this PR changes CONTRIBUTING.md according to the new format requirements. Also, a note is added to the workflow to point contributors in the right direction.

But I do have a question that I'm myself confused about. The CONTRIBUTING.md states:
> If your contribution changes the behavior of `bat` (as opposed to a typo-fix
in the documentation), please update the [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) file
and describe your changes.

So, do PRs like this one need a changelog entry? I think CONTRIBUTING.md says no, but the workflow will fail nonetheless.",62,1065,2024-01-27 09:05:29+00:00,2024-02-24 22:58:20+00:00,2024-02-25 09:19:28+00:00,2024-02-24 22:58:20+00:00,closed,True,1,4,29,8,2,29,8,0,0,2,2,1,2,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,sharkdp/bat

<details>
<summary>Changelog</summary>
<p><em>Sourced from <a href=""https://github.com/indexmap-rs/indexmap/blob/master/RELEASES.md"">indexmap's changelog</a>.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>2.2.2</p>
<ul>
<li>Added indexing methods to raw entries: <code>RawEntryBuilder::from_hash_full</code>,
<code>RawEntryBuilder::index_from_hash</code>, and <code>RawEntryMut::index</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>2.2.1</p>
<ul>
<li>Corrected the signature of <code>RawOccupiedEntryMut::into_key(self) -&gt; &amp;'a mut K</code>,
This a breaking change from 2.2.0, but that version was published for less
than a day and has now been yanked.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>2.2.0</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The new <code>IndexMap::get_index_entry</code> method finds an entry by its index for
in-place manipulation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>Keys</code> iterator now implements <code>Index&lt;usize&gt;</code> for quick access to the
entry's key, compared to indexing the map to get the value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The new <code>IndexMap::splice</code> and <code>IndexSet::splice</code> methods will drain the
given range as an iterator, and then replace that range with entries from
an input iterator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The new trait <code>RawEntryApiV1</code> offers opt-in access to a raw entry API for
<code>IndexMap</code>, corresponding to the unstable API on <code>HashSet</code> as of Rust 1.75.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many <code>IndexMap</code> and <code>IndexSet</code> methods have relaxed their type constraints,
e.g. removing <code>K: Hash</code> on methods that don't actually need to hash.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Removal methods <code>remove</code>, <code>remove_entry</code>, and <code>take</code> are now deprecated
in favor of their <code>shift_</code> or <code>swap_</code> prefixed variants, which are more
explicit about their effect on the index and order of remaining items.
The deprecated methods will remain to guide drop-in replacements from
<code>HashMap</code> and <code>HashSet</code> toward the prefixed methods.</p>

2848,Add Prolog syntax highlighting,"I found [this Prolog Syntax definition](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Prolog) and added it to bat. It is under MPL, so I added support for generating Acknowledgement for that license. Feel-free to double-check the legal part.

I had a bit of a hard time creating this PR because much of the tooling in this repo relies on the `bat`-binary in `$PATH` instead of the locally built one. This was troubling when using my own acknowledgement code, as well as when generating the syntax test. I ended up hard-coding the path of the binary into the scripts (which I didn't submit for obvious reasons). I'm mentioning this in case anyone runs into the same problem.

2857,Skip syntax parsing when color is not being output.,"This pull request changes the `InteractivePrinter` to avoid unnecessarily parsing the language syntax when colored output is disabled. This was recognized by @Emilv2 in #2397.

## Correctness

```bash
diff \
    <(./bat-master --color=never --decorations=always src/printer.rs -lrust --paging=never) \
    <(target/release/bat --color=never --decorations=always src/printer.rs) \
    && echo ""No difference.""
# No difference.
```

All tests pass, and there is no difference between outputs before and after these changes.

## Benchmarks

When comparing it to 5a2a20a in the scenario outlined in #2397 (highlighting a recognized file with `--color=never`), the difference made by this PR is significant:

![image](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/assets/32112321/5821e1a4-c111-4db5-942c-ddd936ca2442)

For the average use case where `bat` is outputting color for a single file, there does not appear to be a discernible difference.

![image](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/assets/32112321/cfab2145-5737-41c0-b70b-72caee1fdbe1)

Nor is there a discernible difference when printing multiple files:

Specifically,

- It replaces `col` with `sed` (solution C in [#2568](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/issues/2568#issuecomment-1938232553)).

- And improves instructions for systems that use `mandoc` instead of `man-db`.

2855,(Draft) Attempted performance improvements for interactive printer,"This pull request is my way of documenting (and hopefully merging) various different attempts to improve the performance of the interactive printer. All benchmarks are run against a 100,000 line file containing 40 characters per line.

## Change 1: Remove an unnecessary `String` clone.
Change made in commit named ""Replace clone with reference"".

![image](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/assets/32112321/6e932665-3b31-41f6-be5f-fd738828e9be)

Over 2500 runs, this made a marginal increase in performance. It's not much, but every bit adds up.

## ❌ Change 2: Re-use the `line_buf` to reduce allocations
As mentioned in https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/pull/2544#issuecomment-1512294987, I tried to re-use the line buffer when wrapping a line multiple times. Unfortunately, this resulted in a performance regression.

2896,Choose Theme Based on The Terminal's Color Scheme,"Resolves #1746

This PR is an alternative to #2797. The most notable difference is that this PR uses my own library [`terminal-colorsaurus`] instead of `termbg`.
Among other things, this solves (or at least softens) [concerns around timeout / latency](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/pull/2797#discussion_r1522164896).

For additional background, see also my PR to delta: https://github.com/dandavison/delta/pull/1615

## Usage
As suggested in #1746, there are two new options with accompanying environment variables:
* `--theme-dark` / `BAT_THEME_DARK`
* `--theme-light` / `BAT_THEME_LIGHT`

By default, `bat` detects if the terminal is dark or light and uses `--theme-<mode>` or falls back to the default dark or light theme respectively.

If the detection fails, the terminal is treated as having a dark background.

The `--theme` option and `BAT_THEME` env var always overrides these new options for backwards compatibility and to have an easy way to disable color detection. As a consequence `--theme=default` always uses the default *dark* theme.

~~I also decided to add an option for controlling the color detection `--detect-color-scheme`. I don't think this is strictly necessary and I'm leaning on removing this. The only value that is not achievable through a combination of other options is `--detect-color-scheme=always`.~~

~~Detection can be controlled via `--color-scheme`:~~
* ~~`auto` - detect from terminal~~
* ~~`auto:always` - always detect from terminal, even if output is redirected~~
* ~~`dark`~~
* ~~`light`~~
* ~~`system` - detect from OS (macOS only)~~

`--theme` / `BAT_THEME` takes some special values to control detection:
* `auto` (default) - detect from terminal
* `auto:always` - always detect from terminal, even if output is redirected
* `auto:system` - detect from OS (macOS only)
* `dark` - Always use the theme configured in `--theme-dark`
* `light` - Always use the theme configured in `--theme-light`

I thought it might be useful to include `dark` and `light` as special values as a user may have configured dark and light themes via the env var / config but wants to override.

## Latency and Terminal Support
terminal-colorsaurus includes [Measurements](https://github.com/bash/terminal-colorsaurus/blob/main/doc/latency.md) for a couple of terminals, both terminals that support `OSC 10`/`OSC 11` and some that don't.

For terminals that don't support `OSC 10`/`OSC 11` querying for the color scheme usually takes well **below 100 µs**.

<details>
<summary>How does this work?</summary>

Colorsaurus sends two escape sequences: `OSC 11` (the actual color querying sequence) followed by `DA1` (which is supported by almost all terminals out there). Since terminals answer in the same order as the sequences were received we know that if we receive the answer to `DA1` then the terminal does not support `OSC 11` and can bail out early and avoid a long timeout.

</details>

For terminals that support `OSC 10`/`OSC 11` there's a wide range of latency: Some terminals take less than **100 µs** while others usually take around **30 ms**.

## Windows
Windows is [not supported](https://github.com/bash/terminal-colorsaurus/blob/main/doc/windows.md). Calling terminal-colorsaurus on windows is a no-op, so there's no added latency there.

## macOS
~~I have completely removed the current detection via macOS system preferences as `terminal-colorsaurus` is correctly able to detect whether the terminal is dark or light. I saw https://github.com/dalance/termbg/issues/8 referenced somewhere in the discussion, but I am unable to reproduce the issue. I am running macOS Ventura 13.6.4.~~

The color scheme is detected from the terminal by default, but can be detected from the OS instead by passing ~~`--color-scheme=system`~~ `--theme=auto:system`.

## Open Questions
~~* [ ] Should I keep `--detect-color-scheme` or remove it?~~
* [ ] Is the additional startup cost acceptable?

2909,glob is called twice,"In this context, `matcher.glob()` already returns a `Cow<'a, str>` type, so there is no need to call the `glob` method again. The `glob` method has been mistakenly called twice in a row here. The correct code should directly convert the `Cow<'a, str>` to a `String` type and then push it into `Vec<String>`. The `to_string()` method can be used here (which can accept `Cow<'a, str>` and clone or borrow as needed) to complete the conversion.

The above is my own understanding, not necessarily correct, welcome to discuss.",20,524,2024-03-21 02:52:53+00:00,,2024-04-08 01:50:44+00:00,2024-04-08 01:50:44+00:00,closed,False,0,2,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,sharkdp/bat

2929,Merge `--style`s from different places using `+`/`-`,"This commit aims to solve #1032, #1161, #1741, and #2894 by introducing a mechanism for merging the styles specified in the config file, `BAT_STYLE` environment variable, and the `--style` command-line argument.

This does so by treating each `--style` argument as a list of style components, and introducing a new `+` and `-` component prefix (e.g. `+numbers`, `-grid`) that allows `--style` lists to be merged together. When a style list consists only of prefixed components, it will be merged into the list that comes before it. If it contains any non-prefixed components, it will *replace* the list before it instead.

Ultimately, the style lists are merged into a final set of style components roughly following this pseudocode algorithm:

```rust
lists.fold(
    init=set(),
    |accumulator, list| {
        if list.components.has_any(|component| component.prefix is """") {
            accumulator.clear()
        }
        
        for component in list.components {
            if component.prefix == ""-"" {
                accumulator.remove_all(component.expand())
            } else {
                accumulator.add_all(component.expand())
            }
        }
        
    }
)
```

This preserves the existing behavior of `--style` taking precedence over `BAT_STYLE` or the config file, while also allowing users to add or remove styles from individual runs of `bat`.

Examples:

* `BAT_STYLE=full bat --style=plain` => (none)  
  Overriding the style from the config file or environment variable. (current behavior)
  ![image](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/assets/32112321/124eec79-5274-4e53-8ffa-4face3465fd3)

* `bat --style=default,-header,-numbers` => `changes,grid,snip`  
  Removing components from the default/full style.
  ![image](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/assets/32112321/14597ded-56e8-4a68-9174-0f2e3c56d754)

* `BAT_STYLE=full bat --style=-grid` => `changes,header-filename,header-filesize,numbers,snip`  
  Removing components specified from the config file or environment variable.
  ![image](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/assets/32112321/680db652-8807-476b-873c-b0d9cda900e3)

* `BAT_STYLE=grid,numbers bat --style=+header` => `grid,numbers,header-filename`  
  Adding components from the config file or environment variable. (current behavior)

## Questions & Answers

**Q. Why introduce `+component` instead of using `component` without the prefix?**  
**A.** In part due to technical limitations, and in part to avoid breaking users' existing configurations by preserving the original behavior of `--style`.

**Q. Why did you remove `overrides_with`?**  
**A.** It forced clap's argument matcher to discard all but the most recent occurrence of `--style`.

## Unresolved Questions

* ~~What should we do when there is only one `--style`, and it contains something like `+numbers`? It's currently treated like `--style=numbers`; would it be better to treat it like `default,+numbers`?~~

* ~~Why is [this test](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/actions/runs/8585106737/job/23526154120?pr=2929) failing under the MSRV toolchain?~~",52,3222,2024-04-07 01:07:24+00:00,2024-07-31 04:30:19+00:00,2024-07-31 04:30:20+00:00,2024-07-31 04:30:19+00:00,closed,True,7,6,376,53,8,376,53,0,0,8,8,4,3,3,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,sharkdp/bat

The to_string() method can be used here (which can accept Cow<'a, str> and clone or borrow as needed) to complete the conversion.

2937,display which theme is the default one in basic output,"The previous [PR #2838](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/pull/2838) shows which theme is the default one in colored output when `--list-themes` argument is used. This PR does the same with not colored output (as suggested by @Enselic ).

The output is:

![bat_default_theme](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/assets/1708780/c5fb1c36-6c60-4aad-8834-44f4fd5c35d0)


I think about another commit to refactor the internal of `list_themes()` function (so it should not the squashed with the previous one).

Current code: 

```rust
    if config.colored_output {
        for theme in assets.themes() {
            // display colored theme
            // display ""Further themes can be installed...""
    } else {
        for theme in assets.themes() {
           // display basic theme
        }
    }
```

To:
```rust
    for theme in assets.themes() {
        if config.colored_output {
            // display colored theme
        } else {
           // display basic theme
       }
    }
    if config.colored_output {
            // display ""Further themes can be installed...""

2995,Update the man page of bat (`assets/manual/bat.1.in`),"The man page of `bat` (`assets/manual/bat.1.in`) doesn't seem to be up-to-date compared to the output obtained by `bat --help` and the options completed by `assets/completion/bat.bash.in`.

----

Originally reported by https://github.com/akinomyoga/ble.sh/issues/458#issuecomment-2156378867. A Bash interactive setting `ble.sh` extracts the descriptions of the options generated by programmable completions from the man page, but the discrepancy between the programmable completion `assets/completion/bat.bash.in` and the man page `assets/manual/bat.1.in` causes missing descriptions for some options.

However, I still see discrepancies between different files:

- `doc/long-help.txt` and `bat --help`
- `doc/short-help.txt` and `bat -h`
- `assets/completion/bat.bash.in`
- `assets/completion/bat.fish.in`
- `assets/completion/bat.zsh.in`
- `assets/manual/bat.1.in`

Not a single one out of the above list matches another, which means that there are six different sets of options. Also, some options appearing in several files have different descriptions in the above files. Which one would be considered the up-to-date information that reflects the public interface? Or may all of the options defined in `src/bin/bat/clap_app.rs` be used by the users (i.e., there are no hidden options)?

<img width=""1480"" alt=""image"" src=""https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/assets/32112321/54328b28-6eb5-4603-a70e-db3113425c2f"">

And when running against a file[^1] with 34443 tab characters, the difference is negligible:

<img width=""1537"" alt=""image"" src=""https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/assets/32112321/4a324161-6a97-4836-ab7a-e100afa0d77a"">

However, it did trim a little over 16 KiB off the file size:

```bash
stat bat-master target/release/bat -c ""%-20n %s""
# bat-master           5241880
# target/release/bat   5225368
```

2999,Add option to remove ANSI escape sequences from bat's input.,"This pull request introduces a new `--strip-ansi` option to `bat`.

This option tells `bat` whether to strip ANSI/VT escape sequences from the input file. The following values are supported:
 - `always`: Always strip escape sequences.
 - `never`: Never strip escape sequences. (default)
 - `auto`: Strip escape sequences when printing any language that is *not* ""Plain Text"".  
    This preserves bat's ability to print piped commands (or pre-highlighted files) and keep their existing colors.

## Benchmarks

### Disabled, Regular File

No significant difference.

### Enabled, Regular File

A minor reduction in performance.

### Disabled, Pre-highlighted File

<img width=""1267"" alt=""image"" src=""https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/assets/32112321/e53026e3-cabb-4aa3-b49d-c6832a8f4a71"">

No significant difference.

### Enabled, Pre-highlighted File

<img width=""1276"" alt=""image"" src=""https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/assets/32112321/29b4726e-0042-433e-b3b5-3dbe82e1682d"">

It's certainly an improvement.

### Auto Mode

<img width=""1243"" alt=""image"" src=""https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/assets/32112321/ac4851f2-533f-4b95-9118-30ac61338566"">

The detection part of `--strip-ansi=auto` causes no significant difference when syntax highlighting is used.

*However*, it does add a few milliseconds of startup time when used with `--color=never`. This is because `--strip-ansi=auto` relies on detecting the syntax in order to determine if a file is plain text or not (and thus whether to strip the ANSI sequences).

## TODO

 - Support stripping sequences in `SimplePrinter` (maybe. thoughts?)
 - ~~Wait for #2998.
    It contains the changes made in b4fe182960e45d4fd9ebd5ac2c4d2e4b4522b144, which this PR depends on.~~ 
 - ~~Update `long_help` integration test~~
 - ~~Write tests~~
 - ~~Benchmarks~~
 - ~~Run `cargo fmt`~~
 - ~~Allow `--strip-ansi` to be passed multiple times (so it can be set to auto in config and overridden on the cli)~~",60,2356,2024-06-11 04:32:40+00:00,2024-06-18 01:37:22+00:00,2024-06-18 01:37:23+00:00,2024-06-18 01:37:23+00:00,closed,True,5,5,273,15,11,273,15,0,0,11,11,4,3,3,0,0,0,0,11,0,0,sharkdp/bat

This seems to be a regression in the standard library that unfortunately they can do nothing about. See https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/127343.

I'll admit this is the first time I've run into this situation where an added API breaks type inference. Seems like it's an entire category of possible regressions against which the compiler currently has no warning.",33,388,2024-07-26 08:14:07+00:00,2024-07-26 09:12:57+00:00,2024-07-26 15:23:29+00:00,2024-07-26 09:12:57+00:00,closed,True,1,2,5,4,2,5,4,0,0,2,2,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,sharkdp/bat

3068,Support relative negative line ranges,"Adds support for relative negative line ranges, e.g. `-10:` or `:-10`, see #2944.

This is implemented by buffering as many lines as the largest negative offset as a ""look ahead"" to determine if a line should be printed.

For example:
* for a range `-10:` 10 lines are buffered and only once EOF is reached will the (last) lines in the buffer be emitted
* for a range `:-10` 10 lines are buffered and lines are emitted as the buffer moves through the file, once EOF is reached the last lines in the buffer are discarded

3071,Update documentation for git diff,"Updated documentation for the `git diff` section.

Currently if (for whatever reason) a file in the repo has special characters in its name, including space, new line, etc., batdiff would malfunction. With filenames being handled in form of NULL-terminated strings, the issue is resolved. (delta does not have this problem)

I noticed that this section is not present in Japanese/Russian version of the doc, not sure how to deal with them :P

3070,Add print_with_writer to PrettyPrint,"Hi

Thank you for making such a great tool. `bat` is one of the commands I use most often in my terminal.

This pull request is not about using bat as a command-line tool, but about using it as a library with `PrettyPrinter`.

Could you please add a way to output to a custom writer, like a String or a file, using PrettyPrinter?
I suggest adding a `print_with_writer` function that lets users choose where the output goes.

This change would make `PrettyPrinter` more flexible and useful.
Thank you for considering my request.

3095,Fix lessopen feature,"`RawOsString` API changed in `os_str_bytes ~7.0.0` and `bat` no longer builds with the `lessopen` feature because  `::assert_from_raw_vec()` is no longer merely deprecated and now requires selecting the ""conversions"" feature of `os_str_bytes`.

Bonus:  `::from_string()` is now deprecated in favor of `::new()` because `::new()` no longer copies and thus made `from_string()` obsolete.

As stated in the issue liked above, the `README.md` makes [changing the default config path](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat?tab=readme-ov-file#configuration-file) a bit confusing when it comes to `BAT_CONFIG_PATH` and `BAT_CONFIG_DIR` variables.

This PR adds a mention about how `BAT_CONFIG_DIR` can be used.

 doesn't break any tests.

That means the following combinations of --plain and --paging now work as expected:
```bash
bat <file> --plain --paging=never           # plain style, no paging
bat <file> --plain --plain --paging=always  # plain style, paging -> the second --plain gets overriden by --paging=always but not the first
bat <file> --paging=never --plain           # plain style, no paging
```

<blockquote>
<h2>Clircle 0.6.0</h2>
<p>This release changes how the <code>Identifier</code> type is defined. Instead of aliasing the platform implementation, a new type is created that (privately) wraps the specific implementation, so that the internals can be changed without breaking the public interface. In that spirit, the re-exports of <code>libc</code> and <code>winapi</code> have been removed.</p>
<p>Additionally, to aid packaging, the <code>nix</code> dev-dependency is updated to the latest version. This required a bump of the MSRV to Rust 1.69.</p>

3142,Create sparql.sublime-syntax,"Hi,
I just had to create my own Variant of a `.sublime-syntax` for the SPARQL language and thought: Maybe I can submit it here so it helps other people in the future.
Disclaimer: I don't know shit about the sublime-syntax Format, I just used https://github.com/stardog-union/stardog-vsc/blob/0ce931c26529fdaf5c6dd58d91e589bbd6944a1d/stardog-rdf-grammars/syntaxes/sparql.tmLanguage.json (thus the comment because I'm not sure if the licensing applies in this case) merged a bunch of files together after doing some research how includes work, and then used a converter to get the sublime-syntax file out of it.
As I see it, it seems to work rather well even though I'm pretty sure it is not completely compliant with the official https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#rQueryUnit grammar specification.

<p><code>MapSkipError</code> acts like a map (<code>HashMap</code>/<code>BTreeMap</code>), but keys or values that fail to deserialize, like are ignored.</p>
<p>For formats with heterogeneously typed maps, we can collect only the elements where both key and value are deserializable.
This is also useful in conjunction to <code>#[serde(flatten)]</code> to ignore some entries when capturing additional fields.</p>

3186,Correctly handle CSV files with a single separator throughout,"fixes #3127 and fixes #2078

better auto-detection of CSV delimiter
- files with a tsv extension are automatically detected as tab delimited
- other files parsed as CSV go through the following steps:
  - if the first line contains at least 3 of the same separator, it uses that separator as a delimiter
  - if the first line contains only one supported separator character, it uses that separator as a delimiter
  - otherwise it falls back to treating all supported delimiters as the delimiter

 supported delimiters, in precedence order:
 - comma `,`
 - semi-colon `;`
 - tab `\t`
 - pipe `|`

3196,Add syntax mapping for `nix`s `flake.lock`,"This PR adds a syntax mapping for `flake.lock`, which is JSON. 

As far as lockfiles go, `flake.lock`s are usually pretty readable and it's not too uncommon to inspect it manually (specifically, to compare hashes and to make sure there aren't multiple copies of the same flake in your flake). Therefore I think it's a worthwhile addition to have by default.

<p>This aligns thiserror with the standard library's formatting macros, which gained support for implicit argument capture later than the release of this feature in thiserror 1.x.</p>
<pre lang=""rust""><code>#[derive(Error, Debug)]
#[error(&quot;... {type} ...&quot;)]  // Before: {r#type}
pub struct Error {
    pub r#type: Type,
}

3201,Rename submodule paths to fix Dependabot submodule updates,"Fixes #3198.

Before:

- [Failing Dependabot submodules job](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/actions/runs/13084738523)
- Fails because it cannot locate the `Javascript (Babel)` submodule (responds 302 then 404): 
  <https://api.github.com/repos/sharkdp/bat/contents/assets/syntaxes/02_Extra/JavaScript%20(Babel)?ref=4fc55cfcec44dba3f67bd79cac9ccf64dc18eb08>
 - Still failing when the ref is master:
   <https://api.github.com/repos/sharkdp/bat/contents/assets/syntaxes/02_Extra/JavaScript%20(Babel)?ref=master>

After renaming to `Javascript_(Babel)`:

- Request for the submodule succeeds (responds 302 then 200):
  <https://api.github.com/repos/victor-gp/bat/contents/assets/syntaxes/02_Extra/JavaScript_(Babel)/?ref\=fix-submodules-for-dependabot>

After merging to master:

- The request for the submodule should succeed (302 => 200):

3235,Replace libgit2 with gitoxide,"As discussed in https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/discussions/3151, I have prepared a PR to replace the `libgit2` usage in `bat` with `gitoxide`. The PR is not finished *yet* because some tests are failing since the produced `git diff` does not match the [exact behavior of `libgit2`](https://github.com/pascalkuthe/imara-diff/issues/21).

I see here two solutions:

* Extend the `imara-diff` crate to generate `git` like diffs
* Adapt the tests to accept the *new* diff format (it is not a format but more like a different diffing algorithm)

What do the maintainers think?

3290,docs(security): add initial security policy,"This PR adds a SECURITY.md file, battle tested in other projects and orgs, (the construct is CCO ie public domain, for example from here https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itiquette/git-provider-sync/refs/heads/main/SECURITY.md so just reuse)

A SECURITY.md would help anyone assessing the project for use, give a hint of how it handles critical no public security issues, and give anyone a clear instruction on how to report them non public.

**IE, for someone thinking about using bat in an organisation or privately it would give an extra trust factor.**

This policy basically  says ""send your findings, and we will see if we handle them, we will notify you"".

Besides, being a good FOSS practice, makes the project look more professional and it is heavily supported by GitHub https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file etc as one of the community health files, so it will pop up automatically in the ui for the end user. 

Examples:
Security Tab in project front will be added automatically

Security Policy under Security Overview for the project will have the Security Policy green and enabled.

NOTE: there is a <...> in the text, where the preferred channel for reporting should be added I left that for you, (or tell me what to add there, and I'll rebase with that).

3309,feat: Implement compact mode header (#3303),"**Closes:** #3303

This PR adds support for a `--decorations compact` mode in `bat`, allowing for more space-efficient output, especially useful when using larger fonts or for improved readability in terminal pagers.

---

## ✨ Changes Introduced

- Adds a new `compact` option to the `--decorations` flag.
- Displays file headers in a more compact form:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3112ebd3-2b5f-48f7-9c25-e3b4e7e5c8ee)

- Ensures alignment and spacing leave room for line numbers.
- Keeps implementation minimal and avoids excessive special-casing.

## ✅ Implementation Notes

- Logic is isolated and self-contained for maintainability.
- Header formatting mimics: ──── filename ────, which is both visually distinct and script-friendly.
- Minimal changes were made to ensure clean integration with existing rendering flow.

## 🧪 Testing

- Verified output with files of varying lengths and content.
- Confirmed line numbers are not cramped.
- Confirmed the compact format works with multiple files.",43,1052,2025-05-28 11:03:31+00:00,,2025-05-28 13:10:37+00:00,2025-05-28 12:02:54+00:00,closed,False,6,5,267,436,7,267,436,0,0,7,7,3,2,2,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,sharkdp/bat
3315,Fix UTF-8 BOM file type detection for first-line syntax patterns,"This fix strips the UTF-8 BOM character from the first line before performing syntax detection using `strip_prefix('\u{feff}')`, ensuring that files with BOM are handled correctly.

## Changes

- Modified `get_first_line_syntax` in `src/assets.rs` to strip BOM before pattern matching
- Added comprehensive test coverage for XML, shell scripts, and PHP files with BOM
- Updated CHANGELOG.md

3376,Fix ctrl-c fails in powershell,"Fixes #3229

Ensures that the pager `less` is closed when `ctrl-c` is received.

The current behaviour is that pressing `ctrl-c` terminates `bat`.
This causes an issue on Windows with PowerShell, where the subprocess for `less` is not terminated correctly.
As a result 'less' tries to write to the terminal, which breaks the terminal.

The extra argument `-K` ensures that `less` terminates along with `bat`.

3399,dependabot: Stop updating submodules,"I personally find dependabot updating submodules to be more annoying than helpful. It is better to let humans do it when someone comes around that has an actual problem to solve.

This will make it easier to keep the PR inbox trimmed.",36,236,2025-09-02 04:12:45+00:00,,2025-09-22 05:24:13+00:00,2025-09-22 05:24:12+00:00,closed,False,1,1,0,6,1,0,6,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,sharkdp/bat
3402,Add --pager=builtin using the Minus library,"This adds a new value for the `--pager` option called ""builtin"", which uses the the [minus](/AMythicDev/minus) pager library. The Minus crate implements a pure Rust terminal pager with fairly minimal dependencies.

There was a suggestion on the original ticket to change ""builtin"" to ""builtin-minus"", but for now I'm leaving it as-is; we can always add ""builtin-minus"" and ""builtin-other"" if we add other pagers.

Another future work item might be to use `minus` by default if `less` is not found in the path. We could also choose to use the built-in pager by default if PAGER and BAT_PAGER aren't set.

Changes:
* When the ""pager"" feature is enabled, includes minus as a dependency
* If --pager or BAT_PAGER are set to ""builtin"", uses minus for paging
* Update documentation, help text, and shell completions
* Add changelog entry

* Introduced as a new submodule under `assets/themes/Vacme`
* Ships one `.tmTheme` file (`Vacme.tmTheme`)
* Licensed under **MIT** (see `LICENSE` in theme repo)
* Includes README with screenshots and installation instructions

Vacme is a light theme originally designed for [[kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/)](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) and now ported to bat. It provides a softer, higher-contrast alternative to Solarized Light.

I’ve tested locally with:

```bash
bat cache --build
bat --list-themes
```

and confirmed the colors render correctly.",59,629,2025-09-15 12:53:45+00:00,,2025-09-15 12:53:45+00:00,,open,False,0,1,4,0,2,4,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,sharkdp/bat
